All days practice have found themselves
on the stage. Championship Sunday,
backto- back events. Does the honeymoon
end on a sour note? Do they have what it
takes to destroy
vitality jostling for a pick
early his nose down middle? He's not
alone. Four players set up a crossfire
on top mid. Nico solo beat. Vitality
looking to play up the guts. All five
here as
UT mod straight down. Shut down. Good
work though. The CT fill the feed. Apex
claws one back. He needs another and
delivers. Quick double onto Nico. Last
on B. They'll piece this together quite
quickly. Where is he? Well, they've
tasked him with locking down the other
side of the map. Bomb planted. 40
seconds on the clock and there's
residual utility. Couple of flashes and
a molly for this post plant. Yeah, the
odds are stacked against Nico. Something
that shifts it is that smoke kit Kev.
He's got the retake package, the full
set. Mezi, he's going to be that first
point of contact. He's concerned about
Pit. Will be aware of the graveyard
possibility. Peaks in. Misses his first
bullet. Puts Fetty low. Apex now noted
as well. He knows where they both are.
Has the time to play with them. Oh,
doesn't get that one. Apex, that's a
very strong start from Vitality's
captain. He claws them back into the
round and closes. I remind everybody
these teams played in the group stage
seating match. It was two maps in favor
of Vitality. Keeping it clean, not
dropping a single map so far in their
time down under. However, it was
competitive. The individuals were on
display. The amount of deagle shots
coming out of the Falcons boys was
something to truly
witness. Speaking of deagles, three of
them equipped make it four right now.
now kicks in with a
57. U2 to go
alongside would love to get off to the
spotless start by converting against
this and getting a 3
0 taking their time this
time. One thrusting himself up through
banana
early any conditioning. You two and a
deep nay down the back pocket. Zu and
Apex good patience. They exercise
patience on those AGs and it does
connect to two. Yeah, same with the
smokes, right? You're going to want to
hold on to these for as long as possible
unless you're trying to corral them into
a stack and right now we can see that's
not the case. So limping out another one
towards Logs. Likely putting them right
where they want them for these nades.
Another one. Well timed. This is the
prep on the light chip
there. They're still softened
up. Just over a minute left on the clock
now. Patience is a virtue. Banana
control will be
taken. Clearing out top beat. Molly for
the mouth. Flash clear. And another
nade. Two of the three have been well
placed. They've shown themselves now.
They rotate back swiftly. Apex making a
call in towards A. Both defenders on the
long side. Yeah, he's not overthinking
this. He sees three say three AG's B and
now testing the lighter stacked site.
Just Monosy and Mag
Magisk the Eminem combo. See if they can
wrap this one up. They might just save.
There's going to be a moto and a long
smoke. They're not really going to be
able to do anything about this. You're
right.
Wow. Another HG. It's unconfirmed. Now
we can see just how much damage has been
done, but Falcons will not know until
the round subsides. And you can see
Radar top left. They're backing off
their saving. They're holding on for the
double dip on the digs. That's the kind
of round that feels good from Apex's
perspective. Like he's just he's he's
kept his team safe and secured the round
with just a quick call. Confidence
builder for the game leader. He wins the
clutch on the pistol. Then he maneuvers
his team into an empty bomb site to keep
all five alive. So this is the perfect
start. The problem is they know that
they'll be going up against threats into
the next. And in the next, Falcons will
take a few more risks, right? And
they'll have the gun round coming out
into the fourth. So they'll have no
issue overstepping. They'll go for it.
They'll try and put these digs on
display. So this is the start that
Vitality are looking for. This team has
looked
clinical being able to take breaks
between events. That's what winning
does. This team have their eyes purely
set on picking up the gold bars. The NSL
Grand Slam just could be three maps
away. They making made some light work
of finals this year. Think about Spirit
in Katavitza. That was quick. That was
easy. And that was the start of the
reign of
terror. So, no life or energy injected
into this one just
[Applause]
yet. I'm excited about the prospect of
them taking a few more risks though,
Chad. We know what the individuals are
capable of on Falcons. A Monosy or an
Eco D can light up the feed and he is
going to have a go. Ooh, just a clip of
the wings on Mezi. One to the shoulder.
Double H doesn't do too
much. That was your first glimpse at the
aggression of this round. Retake. Util
lined up by Kixson. H could be fat on
the
money. Softens him up. Nico, however,
brought low. Yeah, nades went both ways
there. Kicks in down to half HP as well.
Grouped up now. Vitality. This is the
way Inferno goes.
Spurts of aggression throughout, but
still just back and forth. Vitality now
heading back towards A. This time
Falcons, they might be stacking the
correct bombite. Nico will join the A
defense. Magis here. Monisey and Tess on
that short side. This time they're going
to wrap. Yeah, jumping SMG. Hard to hit
the first head
shot. Wrapping into Tess. An opportunity
for him. He has one bullet. One
opportunity. Yeah, that's all you get
versus
Souaning up his flame. Flying around the
bomb side. That just tracks him for one
but down and the round
concluding a 300 start for Vitality.
Just the one casualty as well. It's been
flawless up until this point. Yeah, this
is going to be one of the weaknesses for
Falcons. It's the map pool. It's the
lack of practice. It's the fact that
you've made it through the grand final
playing against the world's
best. You did great with a win over
mouse yesterday. I mean, the way in
which Vitality contrasted with Mongols
in that first semi-final. It was silly.
And then you compare how long they've
had to integrate a new player. I do want
to raise the question maybe they have a
little acceleration in the fact that
Nico and Monosy, but also it's an Orer.
Is it not easier to just kind of the Or
is calling his shots most of the time
anyway? I think they have a couple of
shortcuts, right? So Mony able to come
in and just get updated by things from
Nico and what change. It's going to be
position names that'll be slightly
different or ways that they frame
strategies because you had the core
kicks and Tas obviously Dexter. They
brought in their approach. You mesh that
with the likes of Zonic and Magisk and
well get a freakish team as we will be
heading into the first rifle
round. Be a lot more of that on the menu
this evening. Yeah, those death POVs
they are brutal. Everything the Falcons
need and more for this round. Rifles
across the board. No Monosy AWP. The
same to be said for Zu utils their kit
in play.
be starting two top banana early. Tessus
is just going to be dribbling over some
util. That's going to give them another
wave as smoke lands. Messi edges
through. Zyu just behind him as they
will be forcing forward for banana
control. Flashing fight. Quick fight.
Deco does get his. It's Tessus that
gives him the edge. Can he get out
safely? Just
about. It's a big win and a flustered
Molotov from Apex. Here's Rob starting
to look active on the boiler room lurk.
Yeah, it's tough to search further than
this knowing that mid is smoked. It
limits the choke points that you could
be coming from. Maybe he'll wait for the
fade then swing into
Monosy. That's Nico's kill and Tessus'
trade, but Falcon's on the board in the
first
gun. The util trying to sell a lie.
Bombs on the way back over. Another
smoke would be great for this. just
found
one over towards coffin spamming through
still trying to pump up his chest. So be
a 2v2 on a 45 seconds. So the exchange
went down so
early on and Rob's not overstepping the
mark just yet.
Becoming a bit time sensitive here. CT
throwing a block smoke. Sure. Oh, that's
going to be misthrown. Yeah, but he's
going to play ahead of it. Perhaps he
can exploit this. Peek through just as
flame looks away. It's a dink, but the
AK prevails. They're going to head back
to B. Three on three. Well, Apex has
joined them now. Indecision. Indecision.
They're having a conversation. He ain't
got time for this. 20 seconds. And they
have they've chosen correctly. It will
just be Magis here. He's known to be an
anchor. But can he do anything alone on
this bomb site? They're looking for him.
They can't find him now. They know, but
Magis
delivers. Falcons, they can rely on him,
but
Rob's done enough. Magis has won the
round. Kingston just by surviving makes
Falcon's round a reality. Damn. Touch
and go for a moment there. Majest just
sitting on the box waiting biting his
time and a massive double kill for
him. Some scrutiny around the
legend and a potent pairing as far as
mages are
concerned. These two making history
together being the first team to ever
win the ESL Grand
Slam. Be the first ever to enact the
giant killer bonus and deny Vitality.
And that's the first rifle round. Sure,
there were moments of touch and go. That
short smoke looked a little bit dodgy.
Odyssey playing on the cusp of it, but
they do get across the line. Now,
Vitality, they're not the ones taking
this tactical timeout. It's actually
going to be Falcons because they only
had one player stay alive for that
clutch. You need to make sure that the
buys look as you want. There's a couple
of MP9s. They'll be able to get out
three M4s, there's kits, there's util,
but the worst possible scenario for
Falcons right now is to win out of
clutch and then to lose the immediate
and find yourself in a really rough
scenario. So what are they going to do?
It's Tessas and Kixson with the SMGs in
hand. Tess will be the A rotating rifle
up. Kixon will be supporting Nico over
towards that B
defense. Three top banana yet again.
You've set the scene this one.
must be converted but converted by
Falcons. Tessus has the flash ready
again.
So wants to go signal for the pressure
top banana exchange of nades. Damage
done either way. Significant damage
kicks and gets aggressive. Does well
with the MP9. Good output onto Mezi. Su
trades block smoke half wolf. That could
hurt Nico.
12 points of health. He's got to get out
of
there. They're going to break and go.
No considered the option instead just
going to follow flames through the smoke
essentially calling their bluff behind
this. Yeah, it's perfect and contact and
nobody is in the sight whatsoever. This
is tough for Nico. One bullet bro into
the body. He's in trouble. The molly
can't he's going to respect. He might
have to save. He might have to save. Oh,
he's dead. The sight is lost and likely
a save has to be called. You've
highlighted what this means for Falcons
if they lose all their weapons. Yeah.
Gets the M4 upgrade but might be
sticking around just seeing if he can
get anything through the smoke. Priority
now is preserve them of the four M4s.
The 3 M4s. That's troubling.
Falcons are trying to be really jarring
in banana, which is not going to allow
Vitality to go through the motions. So,
they're forcing out these more reactive
calls from Apex earlier, right? The pack
rolls, the group up, the frame your way
through smoke, but you call in the
bluff. You're saying, "Okay, you're
going to drop back. You're not going to
stay here in banana. You can't risk it.
It's a 4v4. We think you're going to
over rotate and flames catches Nico. So
going to be a frustrating death as will
be Monosy Tessus and Magis holding on to
these and they just took a timeout. So
unable to convert off the back of that
with the 2400 loss
[Applause]
bonus. Unlikely to see them forced
behind
this. Sure, you give over the fifth
round most likely to Vitality and so
someone can step up massively. It makes
more sense. You want to get a full gun
round going
AWP, give your players an opportunity to
work into this. It is a best of
five. Chip damage onto messi to
start. Avoids the brunt of
it. of a non-starter so far for the
Falcons. Tough to get things going on
this CT side without that
pistol. So, more of the same. And this
is how Inferno goes. Let's just say I'm
glad we're getting it out of the way as
map number
one. Dust two up next. Train after that.
And if we go ever
deeper, Mirage and Nuke to round out the
series.
Synchronized half wall flash and a nade
break on that smoke. Very nice protocols
in place.
And again, an underfort fortified bomb
site. Bomb top banana blocked for now.
It's not another HG to clear that on
entry. So, they will likely have to wait
this one out. MC and Robs getting called
back to join Apex, Zaru, and Mezi in
Banana. And if they execute over towards
this site, which they're well in their
capacity to do so with the smokes and
flashes, you know what I'm going to say.
Yeah,
I've learned over the years, Chad, how
Inferno operates thanks to you. Wait
till we get into uh overtime and then we
can get excited. Exactly. Well, Kixen
will try as he might. It's just about
the timing on his push, right? Oh, or he
just spams when he gets flashed and
round at this point. Even hold on to the
armor, I don't think, at this point.
Trying to head over unless you want to
look for a bit of
damage. Kick isn't going to find
anything. Not far off. Yeah, Texas has
come over to spam through the smoke as
well. Showing a presence might slow down
the look of the hunt for Vitality, but
they would love to be able to keep as
many players alive. stump drawing an
even bigger
bank. As mentioned, Vitality have been
putting on a clinic throughout this
tournament yet to drop a map yesterday
against Mongol. They looked magnificent.
Coms look like they're at an alltime
high. Every single individual sharp.
Nobody missing a shot. Mezi the more
supportive element. He was stepping up
and showing his pedigree as Flamesy puts
it on display right there. Flicks into
it. Takes down Kixson. And another round
where Falcons keep the majority of their
bodies alive. Terrorists win.
[Applause]
I mean both generational
talents. It was January 2020 when a
young 14year-old signed with Na'vi
Jr. 2020.
5 years
on finds himself here in Melbourne.
Okay, no AWP still in the server on
either side. Something needs to stop for
Falcons right now. They kind of getting
out maneuvered. You can't just be
trading one for
one. Talking about the individuals, what
individuals deliver is star power and
star power in Counterstrike equals
multi-kills, magic
moments. So, more of the same knowing if
they just go through the default
motions. You don't need to do anything
too crazy against Falcons.
The reps for this team are so
limited. Only the maps they played at
this very tournament with Monosy. That's
all they
have. It feels like they have time to
breathe as well. Vitality, this is all
in their own tempo, their own timing.
Flashes top mid. Brackets are
taken at the moment as well. The crowd's
pretty subdued. It's not a fever pitch.
You're not feeling rushed by the
situation. You're not feeling pressured
by the environment. and you're just
getting a real opportunity to warm into
your grand final. That's how you want to
see it if you are the Apexled squad.
Here we go. I'm interested to see if
Magis passes this test. Every balcony
player's worst nightmare if they start
getting wrapped at the same
time. Oh, an audible dismount. Flame
sees that as an invitation. They're
coming for him. They pull his attention
away and Madis goes down. Solid entry
from Flames. Draws first blood. 30
seconds to complete this. Tessus has an
angle over the smoke and he makes good
use of it. Quick and important trade
from Flames. They're in. That bomb
should go down uncontested. They haven't
cleared the site just yet. Flames throws
caution to the wind. Knife out to clear
it. Kicks an important jewel. Retakes
on. Yeah, Mezzi can let that one slip.
And so they have encouraged a retake to
be attempted. Robs and
flames. Nico getting set up on this
boosted position. Not going to be able
to see too much. drops his tug. Flames
the
same. Bomb ticking. Kits present. Nico
an audible dismount. Are they really not
going to go for this? That's going to be
it.
Or is it? Kixson last second goes
looking. He wants to clear out his
corner. Okay, Flames goes down. They
know where Robs is. Someone needs to get
on that bomb. Kicks it to cover. Nico
punching in. Throw in a diffuse. Can't
handle it. Robs will close it down. Five
frags between Robs and Flames. Yeah, no
doubt that they were going to win that
with so little time on the clock right
there as they break through the smoker.
Looks completely desperate the entire
time. And that's going to force a second
tactical time out. Zonic immediately
onto the microphone to try and stem this
bleeding. Monosy the newest addition
zero and four across the board for the
likes of Tess kicks in and Magis only
four kills a piece. And then Nico with
two. They're not firing right now.
They're not fighting back and Vitality
are running away with things this final.
I want to be a speedrun back to back for
the organization. Lifting the trophy in
Bucharest. the player you replace with
the MVP. Sure, the field of play very
different finals environment
extremely looking for success in 2025.
Falcons continue to make aggressive
moves in the roster realms inclusion.
They made it to the grand final being
bested by Mouse. That's where they
started their run with Spinx. But this
time round Falcons get the better
of little mammal.
[Applause]
Orb is now out for Monosy. Zyw as well.
Will this tip the tide for
Falcons? Going to get boosted up over
the logs and kicks in an easy frag. They
line up for him. Apex unloads his
magazine into the smoke and Nico's gone
too. Tessus, he knows he's up against
Robs in these. Soul completely owns
him. Wasn't anticipating such a forward
position from the CT. test has clawed
one back. That's huge because Apex is
still quite low on HP right now. So that
kills come in early within the round.
Positional control, it's not really
there for Vitality. They know that
they're likely having Falcons
communicating a lot right now. What's
the information? Because in the previous
rifle round, no brackets control, no
banana control, and then they just
execute on on a this is unusual. The
fact that you've got the orb solo trying
to settle it. Oh, he's going to sell it.
All right, he takes him down in the
headto-head of the orers. Still on
Tessus. They're coming his way. Okay,
well retrieves the AK apps though. He's
considered it as a possibility. Z was
even catching for his mid jiggles. He
knows he's going to be thirsting for
information. Catches a nice opportunity
to relocate and it's bad info. Yeah,
Tessa is likely to reroute over towards
B. And guess what everybody? Don't say
it.
Okay, you can say it. Saving. Yeah.
[Music]
Bomb has been planted. It's textbook so
far.
Inferno Masterass on display. T-side for
Vitality now up to seven. Here's the
thing with the Vitality match against
Mau in Lisbon. I'm pretty sure map
number one was the 130 and then that
went on to be a five map absolute banger
of the series. So you don't want to get
too far ahead of yourself. I mean,
wasn't Inferno the um a map that we saw
competitive score line in their last
headto-head? Yeah, but that's when the
individuals were lining up with Eagles
and having multi kill moments. Right now
you got a bit more tape on them and this
is the third time they're ever playing
Inferno with Mony in the roster and
Vitality. This is a great map for them
to be able to control the tone of the
game and they take everything away. So,
no, you won't be saving. They can do no
wrong. Apex even picking up orb frags.
Definition of locked in. Well, this is
the fact with Vitality at the moment.
This team, I don't think there's anyone
else out there that's been able to
manage the output of the team as well as
this roster. You come into
2025, the balance of Counter-Strike
changes completely. VRS, that's going to
control your fate as far as mages are
concerned. There's more tournament
organizers back in the mix. There's more
choice and well, there's more
frustrations as they are just getting
thrown around. But Vitality have done
such a great job of managing which
tournaments they're going to and then
having maximum output equating in wins,
putting them on the cusp of the ESL
Grand
Slam. Now, we would all love a
competitive affair. No one's come out
here to fill the rod labor
arena to watch a
stomp. So far, that's what we are being
delivered. absolute stinkers other than
the Mongols versus Liquid
quarterfinal. Snip of Aran could be a
fivestar and always just looking for
some
[Applause]
hope again. Apex looking to call his
team into the underfort fortified side.
Mony Magic again. Mony still yet to find
a frag. Eco top and out of control. Half
war smoke in play, but the other two
bunker down on the site. Well, here they
come. Okay, that's valid in the block
smoke. They might push through that
though. The Mac 10. Yeah, look at
Flamesy. He just doesn't care and it
costs him. Huge double kill from Mis
Cow's behind the smoke. But Messi will
find he needs something. He certainly
does with only four HP though. It's
really a tall order. Yeah, Rob brings
him down. Rotation's quick. Okay, flank
from Nico. Smoke will fade.
Trying to make the play. Trying to be
the hero. Scoops up a Mac 10. Bomb has
been planted.
Audible reload. Mezi on sight. It's Zyu
Pit that he'll have to trifle with Robs
as well. Oh, he knows what's up. Draws
attention to Kixson in
ABS. Draws fire. Rob staying active.
Kixson doing his best to try and apply
pressure. Close that gap onto him. Oh,
that's big. He's taken down Robs. Now
things get a little hectic. UT from
Nico. A smoke onto the position. He
still gets out, but still pulls the
trigger pre-b bloom. Tess on that
10second diffuse. Zu trapped in the
smoke. Nico smoke has freaked him out,
but he's gone and done it. No, Zu
finishes off the
job. Says, "Thank you very much, Nico.
I'll use that to win the round." Time
just against Falcon. Sure, that was
another lighter by situation, but
they're committed to the plant. You can
see the fusing the bomb having a look
towards the wall. Nico steps out one
second, too early. The smoke yet to
plume in that scenario, and Zyu will
punish. That was just a lighter buy, but
another one of these rounds where Magis
gets a multi-kill. Magic is the only one
that's done anything so far. Yeah, he's
the one that converted them one round.
This was the most impactful in doing so.
Well, here we go again. Rifles out. Moni
AWP more damage. This is a seven round
lead that Vitality have so far. Break
the smoke and peak. Oh, doesn't hit his
flick. Honestly, Z
heavy nades. Okay, well that AWP has
sent them elsewhere.
Lost the limb. goes back to pick up the
ball.
[Applause]
Looking for brackets control
now peering forward. Fliy alongside and
pops over towards the boiler. Apex will
set them up with two. Here they go. So,
is this just for space or is this
looking for the finish? Yeah, a lot of
responsibility if they try and test long
on Nico.
Odyssey does maintain some top banana
control. So, this time slight
information to work with. Freeze up the
rotation, but Robs the jiggle out. He's
going for one too. You could go grab
now. You certainly could. Instead, you
wrap as Nico turns his back. Nico does
finish off Apex. We know that Honesty
got him low.
Magic caught there. Gets caught on the
quick switch. Nico Tess is trying to
inject some hope. Trying to give this CT
side some live. Zy from the elevated
angles coming for you. Good shot from
Tess. Looking good in the pit side.
Makes it a twoon two. This one feels
compulsory if you want to have a
competitive score line for Falcons.
Monosy and Kixson tasked with a retake.
[Music]
It's these two that you got to get past
the star duo. Robs and Zyu. Strong
crossfire considering the retake
positions. Kit for kicks and smoke in
play. Flash as
well. Zyu's there for the intel. Robs
playing for the
time. Patient
game. Look to obscure Zyu. That known
entity. the distraction from the mini
pit. Robs gets away with it as well. Has
the angle. They play it to perfection.
Doesn't it just look too easy? All these
setups, they're not having any issues.
Even in the clutch scenarios, when
they're down in number disadvantage
scenarios, they're not having any dramas
whatsoever. Managing the clock,
understanding where the bombs planted,
milking out the
time and adding another round to the
tally. We've seen that kill before. This
time from Fly rotating around and just
getting caught out. You can see dropped
on the elevation gets a little bit of
information over the cusp of the smoke
is thrown slightly too deep.
And another partial rinse and repeat in
the washing machine right now. Falcon's
getting tumble dried.
Oh, and even a wall bang. What? Silus
just tagged up Nico through the half
wall. Oh no. Consecutive bullets
connect. This is punishment. That's just
unreasonable. Of course, they're going
to connect on the spam as well. Kicksten
gets put
low. So tight. Can't believe Z has done
that. Nico, I'm sure that's an eye
rolling
death. They can't get away with anything
at the moment. So probably happy to get
this one done quickly. You want your
individuals to have a chance to warm up,
but right now you're not even in it.
This is a non-starter. The bomb needs to
be picked up. was back towards T stairs.
Vitality, they're not going to take any
risks. Like they understand what's on
the line. Yeah. Want to make history
here today. I mean, this is for them a
million dollar match more. That's
already the prize money. The Grand Slam
on top of
that join the best of the best of the
best, the elite, Astralus, Liquid,
Na'Vi, Faze, and maybe at the end of
today,
Vitality. It's the team on the run who
picked up
Cologne winning Katza to start the year
with the addition of Ross NPL in their
back
pocket. This will be the fourth piece of
that ESL Grand Slam
puzzle. Bomb has not going to get a
chance to see too many fights
whatsoever. Sure, there's been some
clutches, but they haven't been the
hardest to
win. So, no TZ so far.
Yeah, I mean a best of five as well.
Sure, in the best of threes you can kind
of get away with only a couple of maps,
but you will be tested here. The depth
of your pool will be put under
scrutiny. He's got a kill, folks. Monosy
on the board. Round
11. I say better late than never, but on
Inferno, I don't think this is going to
make any difference. Might be having a
speedrun in map number one.
Yeah, but you've given me some hope with
the reminder about the 13-1 into a crazy
game versus Mau.
It does mean that Falcons are going to
have to wake up. There's the second tag
through the wall. See you later. You've
already comped it and then they get that
hiding. I'm trying to keep the hands
busy because they're not getting too
many opportunities right now. Falcons to
even shoot back. Third of three tactical
timeouts called within the first
half. It's great when you get little
tells like that. That indicates just how
poorly the game is going better than we
ever
[Music]
could. Well, he got the first kill on
me, man. What the [ __ ]
Vitalia noticing the absence of honesty.
I'll tell you that much.
Hard not to. Had to do it all weekend,
Alex. The crowd's had to make their own
fun. Very few of these matches have
delivered any form of entertainment.
This grand finals just getting
started.
Vitality can swallow that one. That's a
very de molly indeed.
They've
been forced back out the base of Banana.
Very low Apex and Mezzi. Hasn't seemed
to cause them too many issues so far. On
high alert everywhere are the
Falcons. Vitality just continue to go
through the paces. Nico, he doesn't even
get to see anybody and he sustains all
this
damage. Oh my goodness.
He's going for one more. Just one
more.
Okay. Nico stays cowering behind the
wall. Well, the threat's persistent,
isn't it? As we do return to this a
defense. This time it's going to be
Tess Longside of Magis to anchor down a
Monty playing from the long side. Has
been able to rotate in in time. 40
seconds. U starts to land.
Oh, he's been caught out there. Tessus
needs help. Flashes are good. Tessa
stands strong for one. A dink as well.
Mezy
low. Magisk same box. Will they overlook
it in the same way? Not this time, but
still gets away with murder. A double
kill from Magisk. Keeping Falcons in it,
but Zyu takes him down. Quick spam from
Nico
back. Robs versus two.
Bomb has planted. Smoke grenade to
deploy. Throws it out onto sight and
dips away. That's not planted for him on
that side. And that's the first fight.
gets it. Isolates the jewel. Nico coming
in. Gets it done. Falcons with
something, just something to work with,
to hold on to. 10 Vitality, two to the
Falcons. This could be a quick
[Music]
Inferno. Heat. Heat. Heat.

[Music]
Heat. Heat.

[Music]
Hey, Heat. Heat.
[Music]
[Music]
Heat.
Heat. Heat.
Heat.

[Music]
Heat. Heat.
[Music]
A T-side of dominance from Vitality
leaves Falcons wanting. Falcons
operating with just two rounds as we
swap sides. Map one of this best of five
grand final. An awful lot on the
line. Well, the people at home know that
the crowd made more noise for the DHL
drop in the halftime break than they
have
[Music]
otherwise. Let's take it one round at a
time. It's going to be a long long
night. Okay, boys. So, let's take
everything we can. Okay.
Not at this rate. Not unless the Falcons
change it.
Trying to keep a cool head is
Magisk back turned as Flames takes
contact.
Oh, come
on. He just brings the fight to Nico
puts him in the dirt.
Zyu playing up to his superstar status.
14 kills, five deaths. Just the
confidence. He He's not scared of any
engagement. He just knows internally he
is better. They're ahead on this
rotation. And two players joining that a
defense. Fal need to explode now. Yeah,
but Robs has these weapons primed and
ready. A pair of pistols ready to wreak
havoc. 30 bullets of mayhem to unload.
Test your bouncing gets you nowhere.
Robs unloads his mag. Gets it done.
Triple kill from the pair of pistols.
And that round signifies essentially the
end of map one. Yeah, you're force
playing the game round right now. If
you're Falcons, you don't take an eco
here. You have to try and fight for
something. Fight for the spark that's
going to be necessary. Flashes. Great.
Nico blind. Steps on in and delivers.
Those flashes are landing at Robs' back.
He doesn't even have to worry about
being blind in that whatsoever. And with
so much ammo, it just stomps them in
their tracks. And Celebrations might be
starting early in the Vitality camp.
Well, here's the force. And here goes.
Kicks it. Giving it a look. It does more
than look. Actually frags out. Removes
flames. Forces the fall back of me. I
might just go into a BXQ right now if
your
Falcons. Why the hell not? They will
apply
pressure. CT smoke lands exchange
utility on the B bombite. Zyu freed up
to rotate. Rob's left in
pit. He's taking a moment to breathe.
Are the Falcons. Apex has actually
called a gambler as he sent away. Oh,
how's he done that? Nico, more BS handed
his way. Uh, and there's util for Apex
as well. And he can respoke this top
banana. And will
Duke have to go Falcons. You've used all
your util.
No one pushed through on the flash. No
one pushed on the flash. Another one
from Wu. Apex. Oh wow. He's done a lot
of damage already. That
Fas Apex takes three. Job done. Desa's
bleeding out. 4 HP. And Mezi's in hot
pursuit. pushes straight through the
smoke to get it done.
Light work for
Vitality. Flying through this one. If
you're apexing hitting those type of
shots against the force, I can't just
believe the the lack of conviction from
Falcon's there. They have one flash
after the smoke lands and nobody braves
the smoke. Someone's going to go,
someone's going to make the space. You
got to try and catch him off guard. They
can't even do that. So, we will see them
force again.
Yeah, we've all had a game like that.
Nico, however, it's happening in the
grand final. Yeah, the big man upstairs
smiling down on one of these two teams a
whole lot more right
now. Lord Gabe favoring Vitality. All of
Counterstrike's
luck. You got to make your own the upper
echelons of Counterstrike. Right now,
nobody is playing anywhere near the
level Vitality have been able to dish
out. There you
go. Third kill from
Honesty. Can they extend play at all?
Another man opener as a nay to draw
back. Whether it's bullets or utility,
it's always death for synchronized their
n. We saw this yesterday as well. Zyu
and Apex both just threw a H to chase
the damage through that smoke. Like we
say, unconfirmed damage, not for
Vitality. Yeah, those will be flowing
right now, reading each other as uh
well, you take that. That's an
interesting maneuver. One way to frame a
smoke push from Mezzi looking for the
knockout blow does return. Falcons to a
man advantage. 50 seconds on the clock.
Weapon picked up and pursuing Apex on
this B bomb site.
Bra not hitting the first bullet, but
don't
you know what's up. It's just Apex
hitting that sitting back at the
site. He just wants one here. Can he get
it done? Oh, yes, he can. Wow, that was
beautiful. Finds the head of kicks and
damage inflicted as well. Finished off
immediately by Zyu. This is
already the conclusion of map one. This
best of five could be a quick
one if Vitality keep this one up.
Falcon's only two rounds to
boast unless Magis can change their
fate. Not to be 13-2.
A masterass, a clinic, call it whatever
the hell you want. Vitality, they stamp
their mark on this grand final early.
Falcons not plugged in. Falcons not here
to play on
Inferno. Their map pick up next, but
this could be one quick best of
five. Oh, Vitality truly
unbeatable. Is this their season? their
era. Dust two has to be different to
Inferno in the attack.
Falcons and to come out swinging. They
get to set the tempo. They get to set
the tone. Or do they? Vitality
aggressive. Mezzi's feeling rather
aggressive with this maneuver. Tessus.
Oh, he actually takes down Rob. That was
the Oh, nice response. Quick tap to the
head. Kicks in trying to close the gap.
Cautious though. His spacing's off. And
Mezi gets away. Slips back through that
smoke thrown out by the
Falcons. The pistol would inject a
little momentum into the team that only
mustered two
rounds. Map one.
Zyu going asking questions. We saw how
precise his USP was, but he might
overlook this corner. Magic certainly
did. Oh, a jump scare for the Dane.
Nasty way to go down and concede what
was a level playing field. Man advantage
means absolutely
nothing. Smoke a couple of flashes.
Falcons. They kick things off, but now
it just slows down again. Monosy, Nico,
you would love to get them started
early. Monosy couldn't get a kill.
Couldn't buy a frag. Well, right now
he's going to need a couple.
Oh, there's one nice head shot kicks in
that individual form we've heard
discussed on the desk, but down he goes.
And now what? Look at Flamesy go. Does
Nico
dirty and Monosy next big dip. That was
stunning from Flames. Look at the smile
on his face. Look at the wrist.
Really didn't see that one coming to
Nico. He thought he had the jump on him.
He just didn't hit the first bullet.
Wasn't a head shot. That was that was
quote unquote that was the mistake Nico
made. Matt just made a bit more of one.
Didn't anticipate the walk up from Zyu.
So active. Yeah. This is crazy from
Flames, isn't it? Just getting peppered
from the side and flicks. Even has time
to course correct it. How often do you
see Zyu putting his hands in the air?
This team come on is here to play. But
Nico, that's what we're looking for. A
deagle to start. He does those pigs in
his
sleep this time in a grand final. Okay,
well that's the only investment other
than a smoke grenade right now for
Falcons. An opening advantage again,
this time with nothing behind it. Yeah,
that's the thing about these star
players is that they can
do the ridiculous a hero Desert Eagle.
We've seen Don do it. We know Nico can.
One is not enough. And Flames quick to
it. He's not playing scared. He knows he
has the advantage. He knows these are
unarmored falcons. It's instant though,
isn't it? just how quick these kills
come in.
Catch that from the death perspective
there as they mantle up and well the
fight is going to come their way.
Clamping down on mid the farm fest. Zyu
leaps forward takes down Tess and the
tail of this assault for the Falcons
will be able to find some room out long
but mission accomplished. Vitality they
have all the information. They have a
great understanding of where this one is
going to finish. And Zo would love to
get a couple more kills on the SMG to
help secure the AWP.
They just put some fear into the Falcons
on their progressions. They know there's
an M4 on site. It's a fight of an over
actually. Oh, okay. Couple of kills and
honestly on the board a whole lot
earlier than he was. But still will be
the
round. Actually significant damage done
with only a deagle and a smoke invested.
That's $1,000. And they force out three
rebys from Vitality.
An orb has been made available.
So were able to invest into that. Won't
have any util behind it. Got his M4
counterterrorist. No AWP for Monosy.
Falcons into their first rifle round.
Resistance required now.
[Applause]
Flashed in. Magis going to not get
blinded. Oh, he's going to win the
jewel. How does a FAS prevail? He had
vision. Flame's just too quick. See, he
wasn't ready for that swing, but still
ahead of the flash. Should have had the
jump. Turning in while looking for that
fight. Now a number disadvantage.
Nico searching. Apex tending to it.
though. Oh, can't beat out Apex this
time in the headto-head.
Just a pit of pad. That's revenge from
that deagle shot in the previous
and nothing to write home about for
Falcons in this one either. Two kills,
no trade available. And now they're just
going to walk onto one of these sites in
the 3v5 number
disadvantage. Honestly, kicks in joint
Tess Robson Mezi. Their rotation point
will be lengthy, but Apex can flash.
Yeah. Also, no needs to block. So, Mezzi
will get spotted. Hoping to bait for
Robs. There we go. Does more than bait.
Gets the frag. Now, they're not looking
at Robs. Mezi picking up a second.
Odyssey does put down that SMG, but at
the back of the side, Mezi putting up a
valiant defense. Job done. Triple kill.
Falcons back to spawn empty-handed.
It might be a bit early to say we're in
for more of the same, but it is starting
to feel that way.
Yeah, but it's just testament to where
Vitality are at in contrast to the
entirety of the professional
Counter-Strike space. You compare them
to every other team right now, they are
indisputably
dominant. It's been a while since we've
had an era, hasn't it? Australas that
was 2019 where it came to the close
and then we had this period where it was
a kind of a you know a tugofwar between
a variety of names. Na'Vi had a moment.
FaZe did too. But in recent history, we
haven't seen anybody as dominant as
Vitality have
been. Player for player, the depth is
being shown, the level of
professionalism, and the type of
Counter-Strike on display
while simultaneously being this team,
you know, by all definitions team, the
players themselves meshing,
communicating, and having that mutual
respect that is required in a
competitive environment.
All right. Well, this is just another
partial understandably so for the
Falcons. Rifles back into the next and
with this is no util. And this is going
to have to come down to hitting some
shots. Going to make your way up short
in towards a flash clear of long blue
bin. They're aware that it's a
possibility. How deep does Flames want
to go? He's been drawn into this. Those
sound cues would have been heard. Tess
communicating that they need to explode
out short. Get past Zyu and Apex.
Zyu still has a H. Could do significant
damage to these Tech 9. First the orb
though. That was what he was waiting
for. Does spot two additional goes for a
repeat. That was ambitious. Now dropping
CT. Apex has got his nades out. Kicks
and hits the first bullet. Shock can't
get the M4 cocked in time. Zyu overcome.
If Flames wants to go down, he could
have had the round. Instead, he holds
his nerve, holds his side. And now with
the bomb now ticking, it's up to Monosy.
Just the one requires Magis to come up
clutch. Flamesy was p brought low by
that engagement on Long. It's not the
weapon. It's definitely not the weapon
for these kind of engagements. Magis
knows it.
Intermittent uncrouches, spots him out.
Knows where Robs is. Can he do it? Robs
can holds his nerve. Converts the round
again. Threatening from Falcons. Yeah,
these clutches just keep going in the
favor of Vitality. Same thing happened
on Inferno. Same thing happening here.
Counterterrorists win.
But in the break between maps, I was
talking to a couple of young gentlemen
and they said they thought it was a bit
louder, a little bit more lively when we
were in Sydney.
What do you have to say about that?
I mean, the Sydney crowd was iconic,
right? It I think it was about a third
of the size of this. Yeah, it wasn't so
big, but they just brought that energy,
you know, had a few more chance. Yeah,
they definitely got creative with the
chance. They're on their feet. On their
feet. I think there was more bananas as
well.
All right. Well, the partial with the
plan into the buy. So or same for
Monosy. Default spread testes up a
tunnels. Nico in through lower. Monosy
palm tree kicks in. And now just outside
long for now looking for a late pop and
go potentially as Flamesy will joust
early. Clear of the smoke. Orphers
exchange.
Neither of them connecting the dots
but two orbs are in
play. Really taking their time on this
one. Zyu back at Plat. to the AWP will
not be over towards A for the defense
instead now playing mezzi in goose Apex
ramp flamesy car very passive setup that
Nico seems kind of aware of he just
walks up short waltz is up it now this
is to make up for the lack of the AWP on
a play game helper so you're going to
need to have some bogey rifles when you
think you've gotten past one there's
still plenty more does mean that they're
susceptible if it is a long play but
quick on the rotation for a mid to be or
the shutdown surprise factor if they
team out short Two smokes, the recipe
for success for Falcons. We can see the
standard execute. Also going to be the
rally of flashes as they're expecting
Zyu's or on the line. One of these
individuals will be hidden from exactly
that. The flash is chained out by Tess
to start. Apex throws out instantly
over. Nico's on the war path. Flame
flame behind the car. Mezi gets his.
There's Flames. Reveals himself. Finds
the head of Tess. Kickson keeping him in
it. Oh, and this Magisk tips the scales
in Falcon's favor.
kicks in very low. H doesn't find him
though. Mag just allowed to reposition.
Zou and robs. Will they even give this
one a look in looking to retreat now is
Zyu? Gets
away. Third round secure for Falcons in
the series so far.
Map two, round five. Didn't start out.
That is a third round. Yeah. But this
one a rifle round. hard fought
for off meta setup from Vitality and
they can't get the job done. Just not
able to trade efficiently in that
scenario as damage looking to be done on
the way out the door. Rob and Zyu, they
take it all away. Like that's playing
the percentages that was around you
couldn't convert and so what do you do?
You make sure that they've got absolute
peanuts in their pockets. Yeah, it could
have had bigger ramifications, but
Magisk, he has just enough money to buy
head armor and drop the AWP. Okay, Xan's
actually starting to take a tactical
timeout to have a conversation. So, at
the first point of
resistance, there we go. That's what
we're looking
for. Find themselves in with the
opportunity to calm the pace, have a
conversation before all the cash in the
coffers is gone. Famous for me, rifles
for everybody else. Zu with his prime
possession, the AWP. There's diffuse
kits, there's utility, and that's what
happens when you save two guns. So,
sure, you didn't win the round, but you
did significant damage. You've kept
Falcons
soft. I'm not talking about the new
generation. Well, that's the potential
of the noise available, but right now,
the game does not demand it.
Well, should they pick this one up, it
would be more of a conversation. Well,
starting 48. That was all progressive
short. The other three locking down long
just drops on beers. Going through the
default paces are Falcons. Kicks in this
time in lower with
[Applause]
Nico. Long blocked. Nessi actually going
to be tucked in towards pit. That'll be
extremely unexpected. He's traditionally
a B defender. So playing out of position
again in two backto-back rounds. Flash
out mid. Team flash. Kicks and can't see
a goddamn thing. Lucky nobody shot back.
So, is that information enough to help
educate? If they jump up, you're into
that. And Zyu does not miss. God, that's
supposed to be a hard shot to hit. Not
for him. That's just a flustered little
row of events there. Team flash out mid
doors jump up dead. Now, the endgame
leader, the puppet master from the
grave. He opted for firepower over
utility as far as magic is concerned. He
dropped the
AWP and now you need to use this AWP of
Mony to get back into the round, but
he's not looking like himself today. So
much confidence as well. Like what a
what a lovely valuable asset Robs is.
The lurk smoke's been thrown on B
multiple times and no one needs to move.
He's not scared and so his teammates
aren't either. Flames
however getting aggressive. They've been
holding for this. He was very quick to
the trigger but doesn't win his duel.
Oh, he's only electron him. That's
important. You're right. They might
overlook him. Will the Brit have the
opportunity to get both? He needs both.
There's the bomb.
Tess gets the frag necessary.
Rob's going to stop the cross. He
certainly can give it a go. He did it on
the exits. Can he do it on the entrance?
Throws it across. Strong arm on Tess.
Monosy allowed to plant and from behind.
Nico strikes. That's Falcon stringing
together. Sonic consecutive on the guns.
All right. Little tricky setup again
there from Vitality. They had the
opening pick. They know they can send
Flamesy out long
and all right.
styled it out.
That one is going to humble the
finances. You can see the thought
process. All right, we can send Flamesy
out long for information. At the same
time, Nico hits Zou at the post. Mezi
only gets one. The bomb's loose on the
corner. Rob's rotating in. Apex gets
nothing either. And frustrations because
the pressure is higher on one side of
the server than the other. This is the
debut with Monosy reunited with Nico
this time in the green. Oh, that's a
scary 57. Robs does manage to find
output. Cancels Nico's venture early.
Round seven.
That should be the only casualty. Yeah,
you get a bit more frustrated in a round
loss like that because the setup it was
out of the box. It looked like it should
have worked, especially with the opening
kill and now you're forced down to an
eco. So Falcons get to draw
to what could be a one round game and
their most rounds so far if they can get
past
this. defining that deleg.
[Applause]
There we go. And if you're expecting the
usual playbook, Messi should be rotating
over from B now. He's been able to find
himself a nice little upgrade. And I
think we'll just see him hold on to this
if allowed.
So there you go. Getting warmed into
things. Falcons. We always knew Inferno
was going to be tough. And that coming
in as the first map of the series, it's
where Vitality were really able to flex.
So four straight into three
back. Some labed
[Applause]
moments. Still finding
[Applause]
success.
Terrorists win.
[Applause]
Another financial wos follow. Vitality.
No AWP available for Zywood. Has been
hitting some good shots. Actually
wielding it quite a lot on
Inferno thereby. A little bit brittleer
in the firepower department of Famison
for Apex. didn't stop him on Inferno
either. See if those parallels can
continue this time. Long fight. Big
fight. Apex going to be tested. Has
support in Flames and Mezi with the
flashes. Nico going to have a real close
quarters engagement. He can't find him.
Tessus provides the cover. More where
that came from. Apex tuck this time.
It's Mezzi that stays active and active.
He will be. Oh, it's lovely for Falcons.
Three members of Vitality down. The
round right there for the taking.
Lovely little pace change. Default,
default, and then an anti-eco into
Alongo. Obviously facilitated by the
spawns. It's always a coin toss. You got
to stick the landing. And Nico's very,
very fortunate that Tessus was there to
cover his
man. Still got to make sure they tick
all the boxes, keep the boss man behind.
Happy Olly Cast through. Take your time.
Use the util advantage. And well, Tess
gets them some information. Drops as a B
defender. Zo as the or here, there, and
everywhere. They know exactly where he
is. Yeah, even hit that bullet onto
Nico. Molly's the default.
Robs versus Monosy potentially the next
engagement. Zwood keeping them busy.
Softens them up. Kicks and swallows
that. But there's a nice find. Monosy
secures the
round. 2900 into the next. So likely to
be a partial behind the safe. That's
where if you have a little bit of a
flexy move something in towards the
lower tunnels as Zyu spotted drops a
defensive smoke wants to back off, hold
on to something. There is a bit of a
hunt as Cash is starting to grow ever so
little for the Falcons. It's nothing
crazy right now, but they know if they
can remove this the next round of plate
be an awful lot easier. Worst case, you
give over the monosy AWP and he's over
towards Tspawn, so that won't be a
worry. Tucked in towards Car Bomb about
to go off. I'm not sure if you will see
Nico push the
line. All right, we're tied up. Maybe,
just maybe, we've got a game on our
hands. Positive
[Applause]
signs. This is that cover. See, Nico was
not
aware. Oh, Alex, this is Zy with the
saves gun. If there is going to be a
difference maker in the server, it'll be
this man right here. What can he get?
Dis tags through the doors. Mezi, he's
on notice. They're out long again. Yeah,
that's going to be an interesting one
cuz Zyu's AK is there. Going to be set
up for success by his teammates. Does
he? He's going forward. Yeah, smoke
break play. Zyu has a little look. Not
overcommitting here. Could be a flash.
They peek around the smoke. Test had his
back turn. Flame swings first. Zyu.
Okay, nothing. Beautiful for Falcons
again. Kicks it in the feed for two.
Take control. No initial fight. You can
see the idea there from Vitality. The H
is to make sure they're not scaling pit.
You could catch them in transition. When
you don't, you know, there's still blue
bin side potentially on the corner. The
rally of flash as they line up. Damage
done, but no kills. The multi-kill
potential. You could see it was there.
Yeah, I always feel like I can see the
idea. The idea is so apparent with
Vitality. There's always a plan. A
conversation has always been had. This
time doesn't land, but the logic
certainly not flawed. Azine, he's the
one who took the tag of the start of it
around. So fortunate to get away with a
kill for his troubles. Rob's looking for
something as
well. Game's not away from him yet by
any stretch. Vitality, but the pressure
is going to be amplified, turned up.
Apex talking. You know, he's won a
Cologne, he's won a major, he's won
Katavitzer. Actually, the big ones are
all his. Doesn't have any regrets. Well,
and you're so close to the gold bars to
join the best of the best of the best,
the elite. Terrorists win. You're on a
run against a team short. Second best
player of 2024 is the newest edition,
but limited practice. Oh yeah. In your
head, you you think you're way different
breed of team than your opponent, right?
You've had more than one day practice.
They've already played the spoiler
before. Go back to Dallas. Eco Monosy
with Stewie.
G Stew.
Well, took the save. Double or that's
the change as a tag. That one's going to
be completely unconfirmed. Just catches
Robs playing close to the smoke. Yeah,
you're not going to like call around a
potentially low V player, but if they
only knew Nico and Tessus could have an
opportunity. Messi's getting little
cheeky with it. He's going to have to
make a decision now, isn't he? That
spread. You're dead. You're dead. Yeah,
Nico makes it so. What a heavy nade
back, but first blood drawn. Falcons man
advantage to extend this round
discrepancy. Double orb investment.
Interesting. And this is the thing. Robs
can be quite comfy towards back of plat,
but if they can get out mid to be,
that's when he's in really big issues.
So, at the moment, it feels okay. Flames
in Apex rotating over towards middle to
try and deal with this. And Z is going
to hunker down long. So essentially with
the CT setup right now, they would be
playing retake A if it's a short
execute.
There's Chris. Where's Cross? There's
the flash.
If there's no lurk smoke, Robs will get
a first pot shot. It be tough to flash
him in this position.
Yeah, Mag's lining up for the door
smoke. Robs will feel some scrutiny.
This seems perfect for his uncrouched
one
bank. And here we go. Yak delivers a
collateral. Majestic tears are ringing
too. Rotation on its way. Flames lends a
hand. Apex is there to chip in as well.
Looking good. Looking brilliant. The
flash set up as well. Flames flashes in.
And it's just as easy as that. That one
feels damn good. If you're Vitality, you
lose a player early. Flash out a lower.
The setup is perfect. The gamble it pays
off. They do not go for the short
execute. A 4v5. They couldn't close. I
mean, that's Vitality turning that
discrepancy on its head. You've just
been read right or you've been gambled
upon one of the two. It doesn't matter.
He gets the tag there. The response time
because of the CT setup. Flames get a
free on the player coming out the mid
doors and then Ross even grabs another.
Beautiful work. That one feels good.
Double orbs retained. Yeah, they showed
their pedigree with that round. will be
enough money for a buy for Falcons into
the final round of regulation even if
they lose this one. But they would love
to try and take the lead. 75 still
available. They've worked their way back
into this map, but is it back into the
series? The odds don't think
so. Trooping heavily towards the upper
tunnels again just kicks in. They're
going to push through.
Suicide. What's the call looking like?
Well, an awful lot of utility has been
held on to this point. We're already at
a minute 20 on the clock and still
players with threeish nades across the
board.
Work smoke again.
Block smoke in response and this time
coming out for the mid to beat. Yeah,
this is good pressure. Zyu and Messi got
a lot of work to do here and he's missed
his first opportunity. Tessus takes down
his partner in crime. It's all up to
Zyu. Tess secures the sight and likely
the round. Falcons for six first. Okay,
well this time not getting any
resistance on that maneuver. Able to
isolate those B defenders, put them in
that box and just smother them. Vitality
have to save and you would want to send
a couple of dogs out if you're kicking.
So see if you can hunt see if you can
take away any of these rifles that are
going to be saved. Here it is again.
Lurk smoke comes in. There's the clear
test. Beautiful opener and then Zyu
having to worry about the mid to be is
under pressure on all fronts. Tessus is
double. That makes the difference. Yeah,
nice work from
Tess. If they can take away one, two
would be great. Then the buy into the
final round of regula, the first half,
excuse me, is going to be extremely
difficult. But playing a block, they
don't want to lose anything. They
understand the situation extinguishes
there. How desperate will Nico be? N
will hold on to his life. But there you
have it. Six to
[Applause]
five. 2900 drops are
available. Going to try and push in
lower tunnels, make sure that they're
not getting exploded over towards B. But
Falcons have done a really good job of
keeping a level
[Applause]
head. There's the aggressive again, but
long that's the opener. Nico with the
AWP this time. A double of Tside and
it's led to an opening kill.
Outrageous. He stays posted on the line.
He can confirm that nobody's crossed and
then you can actually just come out
long, set up, and do a bit of a NV. So
Tesla's likely to come through right now
and grab this blue bin control just to
make sure that it's fortified. Still a
little bit concerned that there's that
possibility, but better to be diligent,
safe than sorry.
Car, he's got his work cut out for him.
Oh, what is that? Hixon spins around,
gets them both down. The push towards B.
He's calling B clear right now, but it
doesn't matter. Zoo's matter is
splattered.
[Applause]
Apex short. Congratulations. You get
that AK to save. Takes down Kixston. But
the job is done. The half is one. Save.
What am I saying? He's got a 1 v3 ahead
of him. He's got the full package.
Hasn't used a single
grenade up against the three of them.
Kak will not let this go.
[Applause]
Oh, but that goes down. Oh, hang on a
second. Yeah, a little bit threatening
now. Uses that utility to try and
isolate Jules, but covered by Nico. A
double or T-side by gives Falcons the
edge. Seven rounds to Vitality five.
They're in it to level out the
series.
Heat.
Heat.

Inferno, a non-starter for Falcons, but
on Dust 2, they've showed that they can
fight back. They have got the capacity
to disrupt Vitality's path to glory to
an ESL Grand
Slam to, of course, a trophy here at the
Intel Extreme Masters Melbourne 2025.
9,000 Australians have gathered here to
witness what could be a momentous
occasion.
for team Vitality and their
history. Falcon stand to pick up another
pistol. We could be
looking at a dead even series in the
best of
[Applause]
five can give a lot of energy guys.
Yes, a [ __ ] good team. Even if it's
115 come back with anything. Yeah,
that's we can go back Indian.
Looking like there's something from it
to be right now. Smoke on mezi. Flashes
to work with. No resistance taken. No
one jiggly, no one peeking. They're out.
Three players to defend. Monosy magic
and kicks him.
Monosy to be tested. One pot shot
missed. Closing the gap. He reaks
nicely. set up by the flash.
Kickst Messi. They're into the sight.
Flustered. Magic's going to be kicking
himself and oh, Apex.
It's a banger into that CT smoke. It's
looking like both pistols again. Well,
no, this is both pistols again. I see no
way that Nico can brute force his way in
from the upper tunnels. Flazy back up
plant, drops in the side. Apex already
flirting for some space and Zawu tucked
in towards K. Calls this the sixth round
now for Vitality.
I think Kevlar's the best thing he can
get out of this situation. Oh, indeed.
Okay, well, they're going to have to do
it the hard way now without a pistol on
their map
choice. See if they can stop the
conversion. We see Falcon's forced by
round number two. Second
half goes off for stay alive and vital
going to be extremely happy about that.
There was no one playing for info. So,
how quick that hit came. That's why you
had the stack. You were hoping you had
the bodies to be able to deal with it,
but that's not the
answer. There is the force. So, Nico
holding on to the Kevlar will be able to
get himself a Famis. Teammates equipping
themselves with the Eagles and Mony onto
the scout. This is where Mony needs to
hit that flow state, continue to peak,
take some jewels, hit some tags.
Oh, disgusting.
Zyu just cancels Magisk's round right
out of the gates.
You want to talk about flow state, Chad?
There's an example.
He's just playing so well, isn't he? 11
and seven right now. Everybody on
Vitality finding massive output when
called upon. If they tie things up right
now, they will then take the lead going
into the next against the Eco. Oh yeah,
there we go. We need one more of those
at least. Maybe a bit of lady luck as
well. Oh, okay. Tessa's dig does find
flames. Zyu tagged up as well by the
scout. Apex walking into kick
controlling the spray. One found by the
57. No one on A. It's wide open. Not a
retake that Nico and Mony going to fancy
their chances. But this
reunion between these
two blocked. That's going to have to
cancel. See what you can get around
middle where these kills have gone down
and hold on to them.
The fact that smoke in the
post right now is going to
belts and braces to secure this one for
Vitality. Get to see that Z shot again
soon. So that's exciting. Did Matt just
jump on the cross? Yes, you can't be
doing it. You can't be jumping that hang
time. That's exactly what he was pre-
aiming for. There's a lot of players
that think they can hit that shot. And
then there's Zyu. And then the Zyu that
can. Yeah, keep those feet on the
ground. Cross deep or cross close, but
don't give yourself inability to move.
Just jumping through the air. Head taken
off. Number advantage now. We're all
tied up. Terrorists win.
So with Galil saved. Famous carried
through. Off to work with and a tactical
timeout. The first called by Falcons
throughout this
map. Now, obviously, you can't invest
too much in this situation, but it's
more about what can we piece together
with these two rifles. A bait and switch
setup, maybe a boost, get the pistols to
stack somewhere together, sacrifice a
pistol to guarantee a rifle kill. What
is the option that Falcon's going to
look
for? Vitality will be well aware of the
weapons that have been saved or likely.
So, they don't have the best of long
spawns for the line share of their
members, so unlikely to see them just
run out long.
Zywin may as well I was going to say
drop down suicide and go for the pick
again, but Apex is actually the one
who's taking the scout in this round.
Zywin might go for a long corner fight
with the
AK. He's the one with the best spawn
right now for
Vitality. And indeed, he
will back in his aim, flashing himself.
What can he get done? Oh, the flashes
were so good. He's been thwarted and
modesty making it interesting that Galil
finds
me. Fight for long. Two
casualties. They will concede the space
though. Mony just backs away. Yeah. And
the information now for Falcons. Upper
tunnels called clear. The biggest
problem is you can't get your hands on
those guns. They're down towards long
and enemy territory. Vitality are swarm
on top of those now. Just low on HP.
Sorry. Monosy low on
HP. Has the rifle, the armor, and the
smoke to work with. Just going to make
sure mid is secure. Well, Tesa's already
out there. So he's likely saying nobody
home. I will say that's the only smoke
they have. So if they don't cross with
that. Yeah. And Apex has the bomb. He's
at the back of this defensive smoke
lands top side. This makes it harder to
manage the angles. Oh
my an inspired timing on his spray
through the smoke.
And he departing the elevation. Weapons
now found. There you go. You said they
wouldn't be accessible but through a
long routing. Oh no. Apex. Oh, he gets
them both done. Tessus did not
anticipate someone to still be car. His
patience has led to that double kill.
Bomb has been planted. Magisk recovers
the scout hoping to be overlooked with
this delay he's put on. It does tag up
rocks. Another tag. Oh no. Straight to
the head. It could be his. This would be
exactly what Falcon's
needed. Is there impact to be found? Can
he do it? Is Majest capable? He knows
Rob's low. Softened him up. One bullet
has connected. Robs just keeping his
head down. opts for the D. Can't adjust
in time. Robs doesn't play scared.
Brings the fight. Catches that timing as
he started to advance. Magisk likely
frustrated. He felt very damn good about
that head shot. Almost made a round out
of that one. He did. And Magic in
Melbourne for Magisk. Had some round
moments on the last. Very important.
Yeah, the fact that he doesn't cross the
bomb. They wait for the
reagress. Just ahead of the curve, isn't
he? Apex. Well,
guns come out. AWP for Zyu. Rifles for
the rest of
Falcons. Honesty will not have his to
contend. Kicks in. I imagine locking
down B. Nico be taking point on long for
now. I don't imagine he sticks around.
Like to play close in case of a long
late pop. And oh, he's pushing or at
least flirting with the
idea. The conga line congregates back at
catwalk looking like they want to start
making their way up cat war cuz well
props for super nerd clubs his lines
there with a h just like me for real.
So they're getting this space without
any real resistance. Falcons have held
on to some key pieces of utility to
block. Three smokes couple of
incenduries as thrown out to block CT.
Apex accelerating. Yeah, he's going to
have a test here. Kicks and flashed off.
Vision restored. Okay, an opportunity.
He strafes in, does find his. Nico chips
in as well. Mid shut down. Access point
denied, but a distraction. Nico and
Monosy. Scarpa get across and leaving it
all onto Tess. Should they wrap up
shorty trying to stop them as they
mantle up damage onto me. Rob brings the
fight. Z was just doing this on his own.
Completely unguarded. He's backed
himself. He's found a gap. This could be
a horrible jump scare for Tess. He's
just not ready for this. Oh, Zyu misses
and he's been punished and Tess hits the
banger.
Rob's getting hunted down. Isolates that
first dual. Nico hoping to be Yeah.
overlook completely. Oh, and Zonic
raising the roof with that one. He knows
how important that round is. I'm curious
with Vitality with some of the rounds.
Maybe the conversation coming up against
a newer roster one with plugging in the
piece of monosy something that could be
the case is they could be a little bit
skittish. So if you go for a lot of
fakes, right? A lot of misdirection, you
can open up gaps and they did. Here's
the misnade. Comical. Not costly one
right here. This from Zyu is costly.
Yeah, you don't say that every day of
the week. No, you don't. But I mean
everything he did worked, right? Tessus
was not ready for him. He would have had
the sight and the plant had he killed
him. It just doesn't transpire that way.
All right, we're all in. Vitality will
force. There's one AK, three tech 9, and
a Mac
10. Utility to keep their options open.
They might go for the crisscross into
the mid to B. Robs in upper tunnels.
Flamesy Zoo in through lower as he apex
back a cat. I presume that crisscross
would be hard for an or to handle.
Unless he brings the fight ahead of the
play. Punish is coming. Oh, he's in
trouble. Takes a head shot. Operating
with just 5 HP. Join the rotation. Two
players coming to his Xavier.
So, a little bit too active. Uh, the
Falcons threat felt real. The opening
kill slowed the roll.
Reformatting both sides. Yeah, if you
can get kicks in over towards B, this
would be huge. The MP9 to help Magix
over towards the B bomb side. That could
be the potent pairing as Mony will now
be able to transition to a standard A
defense. Lurk smoke lands. There'll be a
follow through of nades. It's really
going to be on Magix with the M4 in
hand. And there you go, some peppering
done.
Oh, it is actually looking like Magis
can kick in. Giving up the side. Give it
up. They're playing from out. This is
bad. Yeah, unless Magis could get
something on the cross, but the flashes
were good. And now Kicks are trying to
fight his way back into this B bomb
site. Notoriously difficult to get back
into. Unless you get something like
that. Loses magic in the process.
Recovers the rifle. Someone flirting
with aggression there. It's Apex, but
not already. Oh, Rob presumed Apex had
window. Kicks and gets away with it.
Look at the time. Z might just have to
save the save. Kixson's having a game.
Kickson and
Tess 15 and 14 a piece. Mosy puts the
Jerry on top. A double kill from
Ilaripov. The Falcons have the lead. All
right, you can see some frustrations
there for Apex as well. Just missed coms
as the Azimovs come out for the
Shuy. Yeah, just sitting in the open.
Rob's not aware what going on, why we
aren't playing the bomb. Windows not
covered at all. ball kicks and just gets
two absolute freebies and yeah, we'll
have the Apex frustrations as they will
be down to the
eco. Don't change the channel. Don't
adjust your sets. Yes, Falcons, they
have a lead. That's about to grow.
Double digits after only two rounds on
Inferno. Sean, they're not done in this
final. Honestly, connects
[Music]
Can't be crazy with your challenges
against the Nico. There's a deagle and
P250 in the mix, but you still want to
show some balls, right? You don't want
to be in here just sitting back shy. You
need to be active on your angles. The
deagle swings out. Perfect pream. You
are going to lose that fight. So,
Monty's AWP will not have any support
for now. It depends on the tempo and
timing. And I think it's about to come
his way. Just falling away to provide
long two rounds they've given over gaps,
huh? Yeah. And it will likely lead to a
plant. Commy's not going to be able to
get all of them. In fact, he doesn't
even get the first incendiary. He's not
going to do too much. This is fine.
They're boxed in. Haven't even planted.
Exactly. That Molly did enough. Sits a
banger though. Trying to close the gap
for that weapon retrieval. Kicks and
feeling that pressure, that scrutiny.
Robs gets that bomb punched in. Bomb has
planted. Falcons. They just need to
sweep this under the rug. There
shouldn't be anything any more of a
conversation here. It could just be all
CTs mowing them down. Apex the last to
go down.
Kixon actually farming up some eights as
well. So he's going to look very good at
the top of the scoreboard. But will it
look good in the series? Will it be a
dead even series at the conclusion of
dust two? Three away from Falcons to
take this one. Well, we're guaranteed
train. That's the third map of this.
Ooh, yes, please. Get that on
everybody's screens as uh sure the
threat when that devil kill comes in,
but this is just a classic well played
retake a setup. Yeah, this has been Oh,
sit down. Okay, he's enjoying the eco
bash and every round counts, so don't
you worry about that. Second of three
tactical timeouts have now been burnt.
All right, looks like XTA's not getting
the coms through. We might
have a tech here in a moment's
time. Melvin, is this more what you were
looking for?
So many people. Australia always shows
up.
[Applause]
Melbourne,
[Applause]
beautiful voices.
[Applause]
That's more like
[Applause]
it. Issue
resolved. Conversation
had. Freeze time ticking down. About to
get things underway.
[Applause]
Long spawn's not there for Vitality.
Hard for them to tussle just out the
doors. We'll have to operate with
something a little bit different. Zu
rough slames over towards
B. Block smoke. It'll actually be Xbox.
Magisk more cautious on his cross this
time. Understandably so, but the all
opted against it. Could have gone glass
cannon.
Vitality, they really controlled the
tempo of the game on
Inferno, getting themselves in any
awkward situations. Even when they did
sustain utility damage, they still had
very good ways out of
it. Comes to play on map number two as a
replenisher. The Xbox smoke done
impromptu and props has just taken that
one down with the smoke spam. So be
softened up for now. Kicken the hero so
far. 19 kills in counting. We'll have to
address that. You can see the body over
towards the cubby position.
You now just go into a simple mid to B
split. He would have loved that extra
smoke on that body. Hasn't elected to
try and make that play for it while the
smoke is up. Concedes B
entirely. Falcons are out of position.
Canon get this opening kill. Flamesy
denies and surging into a wide open Bomb
site. That surely signifies Vitality
making this a one round game. Nico
versus Apex. Oh, quick reactions out of
Mr. Madisclair.
I'm honestly sure you get one
constellation frag, but Zo's already
left the site. He's departed. He's
heading spawn. He's heading for the
hunt. I think down the stretch, you need
to really consider your finances here if
you're Falcon. So, holding on to this is
going to be extremely important. You're
talking about the hunt. Next round, only
1400 is the loss bonus. Honestly, has
residual cash. The same for Magis. So,
uh there should be enough for the buy.
But you're talking about future rounds.
What if you lose another squirrel away
for a rainy
day as he's going to hear these
footsteps towards Long. So very loud
about this. Zyu have an opportunity to
remove a rifle as Tesla tries to buy a
buffer for the AWP. He'll be a dead man.
And now Zyu, he may as well push for
this fight. May as well take this AWP.
Make it his own. Zyu.
And he is rewarded.
Presence of mind, forward thinking.
It does have direct implications.
Sonic's turn to take the time out.
Honestly, he can buy his own AWP. Your
biggest problem is going to be Tessus.
What can he operate with? It is going to
have to be something of the lighter
variety. Will it be an MP9? Will it be a
57? They lose that pick early and then
there was no response. There was nothing
active. They didn't want to over rotate,
find themselves getting lulled into a
trap, right? But by sitting by and
waiting, kicks in gets isolated. Here it
is. Oh, mate. What on earth are you
meant to do about
that? And just trying to tuck into a
powerful position for a late B execute
and just gets
caught. Tess has afforded an
MP9 round game.
Oh, he's done him again. Even why just
why' you smoke if you Why'd you jump if
you smoked or why' you smoke if you're
going to jump?
At least he's alive just uh walking with
a bit of a
limp for
now. What a slow default.
This is how Vitality were controlling
the tone on
[Applause]
Inferno making sure they don't give away
an opening pick while they do acrue this
map control. All five down the guts just
drops in
lower. Doesn't have any U to help them
will play Lurk. Eco on the other side of
the
[Music]
doors up short into what could be an
empty side if Mony doesn't rotate back.
Here comes the
smokes. Honestly, he's going to have a
very hard time helping out with this
wall of smokes erected. Oh, flashed off.
Has line. Oh, doesn't hit this shot, but
Flamesy does. Another opening
kill. Bomb down. Conversation being had.
Do you just let him have 10? Do you just
let him tie us back up dead even?
It's the only option. Yeah, just these
spurts of any form of excitement to find
and you hit the shot or you don't and
then the round is confirmed because you
win three in a row that put your loss
bonus mid 1,400 now it's 1,900. So you
really need to hold on to this otherwise
you won't be fighting again but it's not
like you just lost a rifle. It's not
like you lost the MP9 on Tessus you lost
bonuses AWP. Yeah, you don't want to be
broken late. If Apex keeps pushing there
is a chance they can grab something else
but they don't have to. There's really
no reason that Vitality need to overstep
the mark. Put this round in your back
pocket. Secure 10. tie things
up right now. The biggest concern that I
see is Falcons aren't putting themselves
in positions to be jarring to Vitality,
but I think that's because they're
scared. I think that they know that they
can't really tussle with the protocols
and the practice of these defaults has
joined this roster this year. They've
been on a high ever
since the bounty it didn't go their way.
lost to Eternal Fire, but since then
grand final up to grand final the fourth
consecutive EPL Lisbon and now
Melbourne. I think they're going to try
an explosion out late. They've dropped a
corner smoke. Kixon has to play close to
deny this. And play close. He will. Oh,
Ding on another finished off as well.
Tess converts the kickon. Ding on this
double. Marsy gets away with a rifle as
well. No Kev behind it, but still what
Nico could do with no
Kevlar. They're going to commit to these
fights. It's going to be like Robs
versus Nico in the headto-head. And oh,
Nico takes down Syu. Ross will trade.
That's Tess again. Impactful two kills
from him. Ensuring a trade, ensuring the
numbers advantage, but Apex has just
separated. They're not ready. Oh,
Monosy. He had no care. He still gets it
done. If Apex hit a bullet, the punch,
it could have been that 1 v one. Okay.
Well, they were preparing for the rainy
day there, Falcons, with the save. They
hadn't forced what behind it knowing the
2400 loss bonus would have guaranteed
another rifle round. So, the fact that
you snatch that one is a boon in the
economy. Sure, you have a couple players
stay alive. You get the or back, all the
extra cash. This is beautiful. This one
reignites the flame. I said Kixon has to
play close because of the pop. You can
see him transitioning there. Get there
in time. Tessa's also joining him. So,
this time you actually see Falcons
putting themselves in a position to take
the fights. Is it going to be the same
round again? It looks like it. Yeah,
getting audacious with this long abuse.
Flames just straight straight out. Tess
is alone this time. They've claimed it
for themselves without announcing their
presence too much. Robs gets away. He's
already up short. They needed the smoke
and now they've taken down Nico.
Spotted another as well. Do you dare
reposition? He's sticking around. Tess
is trying to bait them in. He's around.
Why has he done that? Monosy brings back
one. Robs gone. accelerating up
long. Kicks, he's going to give it a go.
The flash is there. The damage is good.
Kickson maybe softened him up and Monosy
can't hit the shot. Need a moment. He
certainly does. Some damage on the
spray. Yeah, Flames goes down to the
flames. Nice from
Monosy. Look at their HP. Mezy and Syu.
Brought low. Monosy and Magic full HP.
They recede. Cut noise. Hope for an
overplay. That's huge. Magic has just
found a H. If they start planning in the
site, he could remove one of the two
players with the H alone. He just needs
Monosy to not be dead.
Bombs across should get planted.
[Applause]
Doubting it, thinking they've rotated
back around the world. That's the kill.
Mones patience. He prevails. Removes
side. Will Magis get the nade out in
time. Caused the bluff on the first
fake.
Mezi with getting that bomb down. Majes
with the
dunk. See you
later. There's that moment. And Apex has
been a few of these as this is probably
the biggest spillover knowing what's on
the line. Oh man. Are you seeing that?
Yeah. the emotions from one side of the
server to the other. But you highlighted
as well there's a discrepancy in
pressure. The desk discussed this at the
start of the day when things start going
south when you start getting that
unfamiliar taste of a close
game. Do you lose your poise? Do you
lose your grace? This is it, right?
Robs, he did such a massive job coming
up short. The way that that goes for the
CTS is you feel completely boxed in.
You've lost long out the gates. You
weren't contending for that. Tesla's
gave it up. So what you need is short,
right? You can't defend the AI without
it. Otherwise, you're playing full
retake. And then your only ways back in
are going to be CT or pushing through
the mid doors to regain short control.
So Robs gets two kills. All the pressure
is on Falcons. The fact that they're
able to do so much damage and win that
round is insane. Vitality may be trying
to play a little bit too fast based off
of those kills. And that's why when we
were talking about Inferno, they found
themselves in positions where they'd get
opening kills and they'd pause. They'd
take their time. They'd do it by the
book. And a few of these scenarios may
have cost them the map. 12- 10 Falcons
looking to level up the series right
here, right
[Applause]
now. That's aggression from Kixson this
time. Thwarted comfortably. Apex swats
him
away. Want to see no H for the smoke
break. Zoo poised regardless.
Watch how measured Vitality would be
now.
Everything needs to be communicated. Not
grouping up, not getting lazy as he
searches.
Miss Shard. Monosy wasn't expecting
flames up close, but he doesn't finish
it off either. Oh, magic's low. Lots of
damage has been inflicted to the
Falcons, but Nico tries to bail his
teammates out with a little short
aggress. Oh my god, the flash and go.
Monosy sets up magic. One and done. The
scout from Zyu. Good for it. Ouch.
Thought he hit that. 4v3 now. Still an
opportunity for Falcons to recover.
Mezi's got long all to himself right
now.
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
lots of talking from Apex calling them
into the finish. Midor smoke is that
telling of a short play into Tessus and
Nico or Oh yes it is. The molly confirms
it.
Tessa and Nico bring the fight to them.
Zy will miss the shot. Swings on out.
Too many targets. Too many
targets. Robs finds the
pair and Monosy. Yeah, I don't know what
he's supposed to do in this scenario.
Bomb will be planted safely. They've got
a good idea as to where he was. Go
fishing with the rod in the water. See
if you find something, but you really
need to hold on to this AWP. Your
successes have dropped your loss bonus
back to nil. Oh, and Messi, he makes it
n nothing to be carried through.
Just a swing from K. Monosy not ready
for that. We might have overtime on our
hands. Yeah. Well, we heard in that
listening. It was Flamesy just talking
about how even if we're
down, we're not a team that gives up.
And so far, yeah, yet to drop a map in
their path to glory here in
Melbourne. They've certainly gotten
close.
Falcons take an extra 30 seconds before
their second map point.
Falcons took him to overtime in the
seeding match. 16-13. Vitality
prevailed on Mirage.
And this is a miserable feeling. We
might have
a guaranteed overtime just by the tell
of the buy. It's a deagle for
Nico. Yeah, it's so meeky. This is where
player has to step up and be counted
right now. Even expending your
penultimate smoke just to get across
away from Zyu. That's
respect. Double H early upper
tunnels. Honestly trying to get a little
bit of a timing on that lower
progression. The Xbox Smoke needed to
facilitate. Look how much space they
just get for free. They walk down
silently. They get all this mid ram
control. They have so much
utility. Apex can call whatever he
likes. Gson is trying to play for some
information.
Indoor smoke
replenish. Oh, Molly
flash. Oh, he's been spotted. Oh, he
doesn't adjust in time. The double zoom
not from enough to find the tip of the
head. Pressure applied towards a no
commitment just yet. Kixon and Magisk
aggress towards upper. Info on at least
two, maybe
three. There's a rifle, a Tess, a
deagle, an eco, and the ADBP. A
monosy upper tunnel's now entrenched.
information for Falcons. 50 seconds on
the clock. They could go back into this.
Certainly could. Robs will go looking.
Knows it's a possibility. Magis couldn't
finish him off. Knows it's a second.
Kickson steps up. It's a race now. It's
a full-on
race. Bomb goes down on P. Kicks and
late from Tons. It is that rotation
that's being held in Flames. Apex.
Everyone's ready for it. Looking good.
Overtime lingers. It
looms and it's secured by Apex. spamming
away. The pins are maneuver cut
down. Trapped behind a smoke. Flames
tending to them as they look to depart.
CT spots him out. Okay, Nico's head shot
there. Very light on time. No kit. This
one's
done. Gives it a go. Running into the
sight. Knows the clock's against them.
And Vitality prevail. Two map points
squandered by the Falcons or survived by
Vitality. Frame it however you like. We
go OT. Okay. Well, they hold on. And now
we're going to get 12
1/2K. Teams will get one bonus tactical
timeout for the coaches to call for each
set of
overtime. This one hasn't been the most
explosive game of Counter-Strike by any
means. So, I wonder if we get a pace
change coming out into overtime. Well,
the spawns don't really enable that for
Vitality. Will be boosted. They'll need
for the cross. They want to try and hold
on to that smoke for as long as they
can.
figning long presence. Vitality corner
smoke flashes there just keeping the
comps flowing. Tessa getting under a lot
of pressure and scrutiny in that moment
as they could just be walking their way
out to mid doors again. All this mid
ramp control never worrying about Mony's
AWP. Well, here it
comes. Tyu loves a pot shot wall
bang. This one shy progressing up short.
Nico
responsible. Robs does have a little
look. Flash connected onto
Monosy. That's exactly what Monosy was
waiting for. Robs down. Opening kill
given to the Burns. Look at the damage.
150 utility damage. And there is
ringing. They've lost flames. Tess taps
away. Another five still alive. The
Falcons sail to the first round of OT.
Rob searches out mid. finds the orb. In
that moment, Apex likely wants his team
to start going cap. But the biggest
issue right there is they were blocked
by a key piece of utility. I think it
was an incendiary that was still on the
ground. As soon as they start piecing
together to explode because you want to
run onto a when the orb's not there, the
H comes shell
shocked. Now there's long spawns could
take this. Try and contend. See if he
can find that opening pick. Does he want
to force his way out the doors or just
go for the scope? Head tohead with the
orers. Flashes are too good. Ooh, a
risky
strafe. Maintains long control though.
Tess is not playing scared. Kixson the
same. I have to say the game play is
filling me with some confidence. We may
have a full grand final
here. Kixson isn't playing scared. Isn't
playing like he's playing against an
unbeatable team. Monosy perhaps a little
more
so. Big H.
Tyu now susceptible to an M4 head shot.
Double mollies. Yeah, they're pushing
that goose. Is it good enough? The
spread will be there. Nico throws out a
defensive smoke. Flames on the wall puff
looking for that head shot. Nico not
willing to oblige. Kickson going to be
overlooked. They thought they mollied
him. Kickson solid. Nico there. Everyone
chipping in. Just a rough. A late
arrival. Long does find one.
lost his teammate. He's got time to work
some magic
[Applause]
here. Ready to receive. Jobs are good.
And Apex head in
hands. He's feeling the pressure now.
Hot under the collar. Timeout called.
Panic button
[Applause]
hit. You have to grab those frustrations
and you have to save them for another
time. You don't want that spilling over
now. Remember the goal. Remember the
task. 20 series in a row. Looking to
make it 21 to win IM Melbourne. Lift the
trophy and secure the ESL Grand Slam.
Write your names in the history
books. Alkins. They're here. They were
the first two under the Australas
banner.
We need we need to step up otherwise we
won't win this one.
to win that grand slam once upon a time.
Now they want to be the first to do the
one way and to do the flashing but keep
the flashing
button to get the giant killer bonus.
Cheeky 100 grand on top of your prize
pool. And we've been in and out of those
team comps right there. But it's going
to be getting very tense for Vitality
now. All posted up actually trying to be
jarring to the default.
as Monosy got it in him to draw an
opening kill. Oh yes, he does. Takes
down the Vitality captain. Kixon will
back away. He doesn't want to take any
more aggressive endeavors. He knows the
job is done. Monosy has provided with an
opening in order to finish with a
perfect CT half in this OT. And they've
been pretty good playing from sight.
Have Falcon so far, especially when
they've had all the weapons in the
utility. So now with the man advantage,
it's more than what they need. Mantles
up sets up the crossfire with kicks and
magy now takes the orb over towards long
but we're so eyes focused on middle
because that's where everybody from
Vitality resides. So I count Mazio
towards Green Box, Flames and Robs to
probably walk out
[Applause]
middle. Gson 50 seconds. He throws out a
door. Block smoke. If they had plans in
the next 10, that's been
cancelled. Rots the
[Music]
clock. Lots of utility held on to by the
Falcons so far. Smoked flashes. Molly
even for good
measure. Drops the lurk smoke. tries to
keep the comms going. Double or CT set
up for the Falcons. That's Magix
wielding that steps out mid. Flames
almost gets caught. Yeah, with a bar of
flame. They want to split B. Smoke on
top of that. Mag just has an AWP as
well. Good. Slash is great. Nico sets
up. Kicks in for two. 25 frags and
counting. Sonic watches on with a smile
growing on his face. He knows his boys
have got a CT side they can be proud of.
Not a single round from Vitality in the
first half of OT. So far, unblenmished
record here in Melbourne for Vitality.
Have not dropped a map. The Falcons in
the grand final looking to be the first
to draw blood. Show that they are human
after
all. Oh, there's definitely extra
layers. Sure, the pressure majority is
on Vitality, but for Zonic and Magisk up
against your former organization, you
want to show that you've gone to greener
pastures.
Dropping sides for starting over towards
long for Vitality. They do not want to
lose to a long rush. Plenty of flashes,
defensive utility into the play. They've
got control fast on this. Falcons in
through lower, upshot already. Monesty
is starting to feel himself. This is
what you want. If the kid gets going,
he's unstoppable. Kixson has been
unstoppable. Oh, he continues. A 26 frag
leading from the front lines is
Kixon. Not
scared, backing his aim up against
Vitality and showing up.
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
walking into this. Going to be
aggressive. He was waiting for him.
Monosy
rewarded. Held on to that and oh,
they're so weak now. It looks like Dust
2 is right here. Right here for the
take. Robs his open bomb site conceded.
Swips in. No one's holding window. Ricar
themed gets two. Keeps us interested for
a moment longer. Mezi and Zyu tasked
with the retake. Monosy posted on the
doors. Even a nice block smoke. That's
even
better. How did they piece this
together? A flash from Zyu. Surely it's
just going to have to be the flash. Mezi
will ask for it. Zu will offer it. And
Monosy will hit it. Takes the head off
of
Mezi. Vitality.
An unstoppable run up until this point.
Could see their first map in
Melbourne. It's Falcons that throw it.
Tied up in this grand final. Big names
win the games, but it's the supporting
cast should be proud of their
performance on this one.
16-2. And we're going to train
[Applause]
Let's play Counter Strike.
Let's find out if the gloves are
off. Wake up call for
Vitality. Going to be a 3 0 here this
evening. You're going to have to work
for your
money. We find a bit more of that
explosive nature in your face. train the
newest addition to the map pool being
pushed looking for a jewel. Honestly,
Jewel Berettes by a partner in crime
just they both can set up a bit of a
crossfire.
Yeah, it's about the fight. They seem
very aware of the possibility. Apex and
Flames partner up. That's the fight.
That's the fight. That's the head shot.
Both of them profit.
Potency waines. Two kills and now on
track for their first pistol of the
series.
Flash does catch Tess. Nico can chip in
as well. Kicks in under scrutiny. Messi
is out asking questions of Kixon. But
damn, he delivers again. A high-flying
performance from Kixson. Now Tess with a
double kill to secure it. Their first
pistol. And look what it means to
them. Not a single kill for Vitality to
boast going into round number
two. Likely to see the eco no bomb going
down and some sharp shooting. starting
to
believe. You add the world number two, a
prodigy, a generational talent to a
roster. Sure, Dexter, you're the MVP
over in Bucharest. This is a different
field. This is an arena. And Mony is one
of the absolute best Counter-Strike
players. There's no question about that.
Paired back up with his
equal. Nico and Mony side by side.
Yeah, there's one thing Nico wants, one
goal, and that is to have a trophy
cabinet that matches his undisputed
ability. Eco bash ahead of us now is
just going to bait out the util.
Vitality P250, a $300 investment for
Apex just to make sure that there is
potential for a threat, but they're
going to really take their time about
this. And I'm hoping that we do get a
bit more of a back and forth, crazier
mid rounds, less saving. And because we
are in the newest map of the pool, I'd
imagine that these teams don't have
their protocols as ironed out,
especially on the vitality side of the
server for
Falcons. This is all a new feeling to
them. So Ivy May now grouped up box
holes just with an opportunity to farm
honesty to assist. So, the two who
opened up last round could do the same.
Yet again, you take a bomb plant here if
you're Vitality.
I mean, long range fights with M4s up
against unarmored opponents. I just
don't see a way in which this goes
wrong. Getting a little bit of an
opportunity to get the bomb closer to
the site. The code. Yeah, he's light on
bullets. Opts for the dual barrettes to
try and deny it. And the bomb goes down.
Mission accomplished for Vitality.
Job done.
In the absence of kills, you'll take a
plant. Yeah. And both of them will be
happy with that, right? Everybody stays
alive for the side of the Falcons.
That's huge. No investments required
already. And Vitality get the bomb down.
Give themselves a little bit of extra
cash to work with. So, we could bring
out the AWP if he wants to go glass
cannon, but it needs to start now. You
saw those frustrations from Apex
starting to bubble over towards the tail
end of map number
two. Now, they know what it takes to
win. looking for their third trophy of
the year. Actually, sorry, make that the
fourth. Be the third in an
arena. Kicks in with that SMG. Him and
Tess were massive on Dust 2. Can they
keep up that
form? This is a bit different. Nico
starting at
B. There's the high spams. It's that
deep smoke that Ross has thrown. It
couldn't have been better. It denies the
info Nico was searching for.
They're aware that there's a player who
started high ramp with those bullets
coming through. Magic is actually
playing back of low ramp
train on the bomb train. Kicks it up
towards Ebogs. Tessa is worrying about
Ivy. We're about to have a
fight. Yeah, Kixon gets that info
safely, but oh, they line up for Monosy.
He takes down the two Frenchmen. Desi
will chip in for one. Make it two. He's
keeping him in this. He's keeping this a
conversation. He's blocking him in the
smoke.
Robs is like, there's a wall there that
I wasn't familiar with. Well, they have
a good idea where one of these players
has gotten off to. Time to work with 50
seconds on the clock. Ross might catch
this. Oh no, Magis overextends. And now
after
Messi's destruction of two, they regroup
in a twoon two.
Uncertainty grows in the strong position
for Nico. He has got good timing on this
oil peak. Oh, timing everything. Going
to get cleared out. Nice head shot
found. Retreats. Turn tail. Tucks. It's
up to me. Needs to leave the round with
four kills. What a banger. Cracks the
skull of Tess. One more victim. Has he
got it? He can't touch him.
Nico delivers and keeps them undefeated
on train.
Okay, that one's touch and go for a
moment. That started very well. Well,
the multi kill from modesty, but they
almost clawed that one back.
Vitality. They're getting away with
bloody murder on Inferno. Solid, solid
attempt from Mezi there. We'll get to
see the highlights. So, this is the
block in the smoke. Just going to hear
that just wasn't holding W. Otherwise,
he would have he like Rob's got that
info. The magic
didn't. And you see the steel coming
down to Nico. That was the last bullet
of the M4. Look what it means.
All right. Partial B for Vitality. Five
deagles light and looking for PX Monosy.
He'll be the first incision. Oh, he has
arrived in this grand final. And this is
the thing with Falcons. You have these
very strong individuals. They can hit a
flow state. They can be the spanner in
the works. They can
be giant killers.
Yeah, we heard it from Jacob on the desk
as well. Says that though he lacks the
reps, this is a map that could suit the
style of play of Monosy.
And he's off to an early start.
as he laid Ivy Lurk. The other three
over towards
B going to have to hit some absolute
bangers to break it to the side. Zu
clears out high ramp says nobody's home
just got smoked. Maybe they want to do
the classic, you know, jump down bomb
off the ramp and oh no, flash and go.
Here they are in towards B. Got the
angle gets the warning and a H that
looks destined for damage. Rob swallows
it. He would love the plant here. That's
exactly what they're
prioritizing. Who gets that bomb
planted? Retake should
be comfortable. Should just be a
formality. It's taking shape just like
it should. These drops. I was deagle. A
little bit of a discrepancy, but so many
targets. So many targets. No
chance. Four to zero. Apex Flamesy yet
to contribute a frag at the starting
stages of train. Oh, sounds like
Falcon's on map number one. True. All
right. Well, Max lost bonus. Bomb goes
down. There's plenty of cash. There's
the availability for the Zyu AWP. And
now they can really start working on
this T-side of
train. How long before they post a
round? How bad do the frustrations
mounting up the sandwich? Smoke I think
is Robs.
They're trying to get a player out mid
early.
Oh, I think he's missed the smoke.
That's not Yeah, no, that's L's on the
roof. Yeah, the the lineup looked wrong.
He looked like aiming way too far to the
right hand side. Oh, mess. He takes
caution. They're looking rough right
now. They are looking shaky. There it
is. The miss smoke.
Oh, May kicks it. He wants to fight. He
wants to aggress just as Yanko request.
Four on four.
And there's a nice catch. Tes gets a
little so deep so early. 20 on the
clock. He just heard S here and
stampeding boots. Okay, so what? So he's
he's going to flash him out. Yeah,
fighting early. Pop swinging in leg shot
could finish him off with the flames and
extinguishing the retreat for the or
spam comes through. Want to see gets
away. Nade to try and find him. Zyu
close. Smoke on camera. Bomb to be
planted. Shape it up nicely for a
Vitality first. Expect this. Flank from
[Applause]
Nico. They're all separate. Coming in
from three different entrance
ways. Flames tucked on that box. Flasher
mate. Yeah, maybe. Oh, blinded. Oh, he
even tagged him. How is Flame still
alive? Still yet to contribute. Monosy
ensures that continues. But here's Syu.
Time sensitive for the two of them.
Smoke on the bomb. You got to get on
that diffuse. They're not going to have
it. Zyu denies. Zyu gets Vitality on the
board. Okay, now we've got some fight.
Can understand why Nico goes for that
second eye push. There's no way that's
going to be expected whatsoever. Tess
was a crazy move, but at least that
runway was opened for a later maneuver.
The teamwork was still there under
pressure while stuck to the bomb train.
Flash comes through. Fency doesn't get
the kill, but at least the comps are
flowing. A weird start with a smoke. An
opening kill with a wombo combo. The
open four kicks it. Of course, there's
money for the buy. Back underway we go.
Multiple rounds required if you want to
break the bank balance of Falcons. Fli
looking to harass making sure the pop
control is not so easy. Magic's also
jarring up lower ramp. Three players
towards Ivy this time
round. That's in their presence. They're
not going quietly. A flash to establish
the line. Zyu ors in deep.
[Applause]
[Music]
CT utility extremely limited
right on Hyram. Rob peaks in. Robs loves
a lurk. Well, that's going to reject the
entire setup. That's the B defender
dead. You don't play one player towards
B. So, you're going to have to hedge
another member over. It's Nico right
now. And there was no indication to go
there. That's just Rob's just trying to
get some space. So, the fact he gets
that type of a kill is an absolute gift.
Nico has nothing to report. Apex
prepares for the onslaught of utility.
They're going to go out main. Monosy,
he's up close and personal. Ebs. He will
need to do some combat orping to win
this round.
He's got the skill
set. He's going to be vulnerable to pop
eventually. Buys time. Here they come.
That's the headshot found as he dips
back. Rob smoke. Oh, the repeat into the
There he is. There he is. Double
in quick succession. Three in total. Job
is done. Apex, what's he supposed to do
with 4 HP? Test hunts it
down. He's starting to believe.
Melbourne's starting to
believe and Apex, he's starting to
doubt. The kids are calling it a crash
out. You'd hate to witness one live in
Rod Lever, but modesty, this is what you
want to see. Oh, the leg shot. Just Zyu
hitting his target, but three HP all he
needs for a third.
Look at this. Straight into something
about the round. Not into the next what
he's unhappy with. So, a timeout taken.
Conversation had hero AK equipped.
Actually, no. There's enough for the
buy. Don't you worry about that. Claims
he might be a little bit light
on. He's going to operate with a tech 9.
And so everybody else has the AK-47s in
hand. Kicks it down to an SMG. So both
teams with
emissions. Do we get the sandwich mode
to land this time? Yes. No issues. X-ray
showing ramp. No, no way in that smoke
lands again to deny Nico.
Tessa's got a big one here. Real
opportunity. If he smokes out pop now,
it's going to disrupt their X. They're
going to have to go through this. The
flashes are good. They catch Kixson. A
response from Tessas, but just the one.
It's Mezzi who finds that double
impact. Bomb is onto the site. Monosy
with magic partnered up as well. Gets
away with an equalizing frag and dips
back to Khan. Play for this retake.
Monosy missed shot getting run out by a
tech n. This is scary for an ora. He
knows that gap goes flames shuts him
down. Nico next challenge. Robs too
good. Should be a plant. Should be the
round. Magisk late to the party. Didn't
even get invited. Yeah. Well, they know
this is the B defender. So, you want to
check for Pop. Make sure he's not coming
through towards CT spawn or connector.
No way. He's going around the world.
Mosburn is 1400 going into the next. So,
bottom of the barrel for
Falcons. Bai is going to look very weak.
Honestly, he might be able to bring out
a scout. Mag should be the only rifle
unless he drops a
Famis. Would be enough money to enable
another
M4, but that's more like it. Long as he
hits that shot onto Flames, he could be
a completely different round. But he's
able to run him down, get the Tech9 in
the face, get the most important kill.
And that utility you highlighted as
they're coming out of Pop. The flashes
are so good. That aggressive setup
towards Ebos to deal with that
crossfire. They're just so blind, unable
to contribute. And there you have it,
another round on the board. Just a three
round game. Yeah, if those flashes are
even slightly worse, different round.
This one opens it up. If Team Vitality
win this round, they can get within one
round, right? So, this one is worth
two. And then again, the next rifle
round that Falcons are going to have is
going to be very weak
on. So, keep that in mind. A very
important round for Vitality to win, not
only for the scoreboard, for Apex's
frustrations.
Distinct advantage in the financials.
They gambled outside. Nobody playing B.
Mag just started towards Ka and now he's
going to rotate back. It wasn't the
rush.
Tessus, this is not going to be
easy. He has to stay active cuz he's
playing a jiggle smoke defense. But oh,
there we go. That's what he wanted. He
gets the spots. Mezi doesn't lose his
life to the AWP and holds onto his
smoke. Yeah, calling the bluff there as
Tessas understands the value of the
piece of utility. Now all exchange
completely stall out this IV progression
a clear you're not going to go through
it maintain look for a peak see if
they're going to transition in towards
the back lines to deal with the leak on
that smoke but as we can see TS has full
control now they know they have the
weapon and the utility advantage they
could go for this again and look at the
rotation that's happened on the radar
it's a very unique mini map right now
there you go the stubbornness does
prevail back down stick to their guns
and they will get this space that
they're looking for Tessas
communicate on the smoke. Is there a gap
on this? Yes, there is. Oh, we can do
something with that with the flash.
Maybe he's going to have some
uncertainty. A bit of sound cues
perhaps. Mezi slips
through counting. Two body starts to
spam. Apex responds to bullets that do
connect. Puts him on half health.
Rotation on the way. Starting to scar.
Apex saying this site is suspiciously
quiet. That's the bomb down. Magisk
however catches me. They'll have a man
advantage for this retake. So many
bodies all grouped up. Apex is going to
get a jump scare as he rounds this
corner. Zoo got a suspicion. Nico
holding beheads Apex. Look at the plant
though. It's back bomb. Yeah, it's not
planned for Zyu. Not easily. He does
have a molotov though. That will prove
useful if he doesn't smoke in the mix.
Could get awkward. Hits his first onto
kick. Contest closing the gap. Flames.
He chips in. Keeps us level. Time
sensitive. We need to get on that
diffuse. Falcons have no kit. A 10second
diffuse on the back of the bomb train.
There's the molly. There's the molly.
Where's the smoke? Flames another. Nico
and Monosy fighting tooth and nail.
There's no time. Is there time? I'm not
sure. He's not sure. Going to be damn
close. I don't think so. I don't think
so.
Oh, down to the
[Applause]
wire. That's a force by victory. Ripped
away. Vitality. You can't be fumbling
those. Everybody played away from the
bomb. The molly wasn't
spreading and feeling himself
now getting away with murder.
It's rare you see a player not sure if
he's got it. Like he's sitting there
scratching his head, not sure,
celebrating as the defuse actually comes
through.
You don't get closer than that. That is
close. An immediate timeout afterwards
as well. Letting Vitality think about
it.
It's hot in here.
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
Vitality have enough to buy back down
for me. Apex has had enough. Yeah.
Straight out. Look at this. Back to his
entry frag days. First man in best dress
and Eco can fail to address the forward
push. Oh, there's Tessa's quick one
back.
takes down Z with Kixster just doing the
flashbang dance completely blinded off.
Monosy misses that pixel onto the top of
the red ladder. Won't get many more
chances. Apex just runs him down laying
down the law. A pace change of epic
proportions. We're going tip for tat now
and Apex has clearly had
enough running out taking the spawn
finding the entry. You can see he was
putting his will on that round and you
can see there's been some scenarios
where he's not happy with the way that
his players have addressed certain
situations. So
chosen what he wants. Yeah, he's going
to put it on the line. Now it's just the
B defender in connector. Just doubled
his kill total. Don't give away the AWP.
That's all I'm
saying. Is he hard clear? Yes, he does.
Apex three-piece feed now. Three rounds
converted.
I'll be honest, I never thought I'd see
the day that we would have Falcons as a
fan favorite in an arena. No, that's
true. That's happened quick.
Huge head shot. Nico could believe it.
Yeah. Elation to
frustration. 1400 into a force. Double
scouts if
Vitality. Lots of tags
available. Doesn't look like a winnable
round, but there's always a
[Applause]
chance. Oh, he had that little shadow.
caught a glimpse. Oh, Mony's Mon dead.
Yeah, drops a free frag for him. Nothing
out of Mony's scout. Hang on. Perhaps
they overlook it. Yeah, Zyu. False sense
of security that Eco D kept humble. It's
just Gixon and he's taken out of the
round. Convincing. Okay, four rounds.
T-side destined for a fifth and the
final rifle round of the first half of
map number three is going to be a light
one.
[Applause]
A free round then a moment's rest.
Didn't know I got that big. You know,
he's got the the Coca-Cola license.
Yeah, exactly.
What's your plan, Kicks? A single flash
back. Yeah, I think just flash him into
main. Oh, how many did he get? Oh, flame
farming. Farming. Fun for
Flames over in a flash. Terrorists win.
That's
fast. That smile returns to Dan's face
for a moment.
[Applause]
Big difference between 75. I I do mean
it. It's just hard to say with a
straight face, but there is a big
difference for Falcons here. They're
tied up. Six round hall on the T-side of
train and just having a little more of a
cushion as you swap sides and take to
your own offense.
Oh, looks like an inner call early.
Let's get Zy was up on low ramp.
Manchester smoked it himself. Push the
double. That might be it. They might
accelerate on this. Do they have the
audacity to just push the pedal to the
metal? It would have been ill advised.
Nico is there already. Yeah, and there
was flashes there as well. So, expecting
someone to be setting him up.
That's the right understanding of the
situation and considering some of the
moments where Vitality rushed it on D2.
It did come back to cost them.
You get to watch that CT side start to
morph.
Whether you go for an aggressive push
into pump feels quite deadly into main
clearing left and right. Ivy is a
country mile of a point of rotation.
Well, this is a gamble. If it's too
quiet for too long, you will need to
push.
Yeah. A lot of responsibility to Mony as
well. like he's going to be worried
about Ivy as well. One man responsible
for over half of the map.
Shoulder so easy for Zyu. Gets that
advantage further away from the angle of
unknown. Nico sure unknown does get
overlooked by Zyu. Finds one back but
here's Monosy. They're not clearing him.
See get behind the box in time. Flame
should have him. Shuts him down. Opens
up the round. Tessa sticking around. Oh
no. Turns around. Oh, he gets it done.
Tesla's triple gives Falcus the edge as
we take a break.
[Music]
[Applause]

Heat. Heat.

[Music]
[ __ ] it. Yeah. Where are
[Music]
[Applause]
you?
[Music]
Heat.
[Music]
Heat.

Heat. Heat.
Heat.
[Music]
Heat.
Heat
[Music]
up here.
[Applause]
[Music]
This third map is delivering. Pal can
swap over to the T-side. Vitality, they
must five on their attack without the
pistol. The Falcons find their second
and inconsecutive fashion pistols to
take train to another level. Moses has
arrived, ladies and
gentlemen. Combination with Tessa's 24
frag total to the 19 of the other three.
This is definitely looking like a B
finish. Making no secret of it either.
They're already in through white walls.
Apex behind the low ramp train. Robs
playing on the bomb train. Rotation
point. It's miles away right
now. Looks like they're going to clear
out towards Pop. I'm sure nobody's home.
Flames will get a lick of information.
Maybe they'll start floating back
towards Connector now.
It's a full like XC on this pistol.
Yeah, two smokes, two flashes, and the
molly. Here they go. Apex was holding
that H. How much damage does it do?
Solid work. But that's the head shot
from Rock needs more of that running
blocking. Can't adjust. Yes, he can.
Finds the head. Mezi dead as well. Zyu
and Rob. What have you got? Nice work on
the dual bar as dispatch of kicks and
drops down. Gets away with his life. Oh,
head shot found as well. Robs and Zyu
doing them dirty. Gets the info on that
ladder. Bomb ticking. Magic in the
clutch. Has he got it in him? Zyw
strakes away. Can't Oh no. Needed to be
clean. Zyu and Rob bring them
down. Double kill each. Work their way
back into the sight and split the
pistols down the middle on train. Love
the call there from Falcon. The palming
into the Glocks up close. Just the deep
connector smoke. The way that they're
able to clear over towards the back of
the low ramp tra and high ramp. The new
position. We're just going to get the
job done now with the bomb going down.
Are we going to see a force? I think the
answer should be yes. You can still
tussle for economic control. You can
break Vitality and well, you should have
a conversation about it. Don wants to
make sure they are
sure. Already seen Galil's investor, but
doesn't have to stay that way. Sell back
available for an awful lot early. So,
this is a big decision to be making.
in an AK bested by Tess. He'll actually
equip Monosy with that. So, two Galils,
an AK,
and a Kixson weapon of choices. So, the
deagles and utility will be on Kixon and
Tessus. The heroes of the last map
aiming to set up their stars on this
one. I'm not sure if you can play for
anything quickly. You might have to wait
out the initial protocol utility,
especially considering how little you've
got of your own. Just two full belts,
that's it.
Three rifles are staying together. Do
they want to go pop together and look
for a bit of a challenge? No, Nico wants
to do a war back lineup. He's
been cooking in that department. Well,
if you were going to question if it is a
force buy or not, there you go. There's
your answer. Straight into the round.
Spams a gal. Okay, yep, they bought.
Thanks for that early information.
potential to maybe just walk the rifles
out high ramp as the utility is thrown
by the others, but there's still plenty
of options available for this finish.
They investigate as a group. They find
nothing. Still procedural on their
clears. Apex has come over and he's been
in the lab as well. Smoke thrown at
range to block deep. This is going to
make things quite awkward. You have to
worry about players luring him behind
this. And he'll still no clear
indication of the finish.
Now with the position of kicks in and
Tessus, do they throw the nades? Is it a
fake? Oh, oh, oh. Mhm. This could be the
round right here. Yep. Just was falling
back. Okay, not the clean head shot.
Tessus cancels his nades. It will
disrupt them, but do we still go? It
looks like they want to come out pop.
So, util from outside main and the three
rifles come out pop and take these long
range fights.
Logic is sound. Flames looking down.
Careful for the flashbangs.
30 seconds. They're going to have to
commit to this. There's the flash.
There's the pop. There's the swing.
Dance. Oh, damage. The flames goes down.
Hiding out on the site. Sy will start to
activate for the cross as well. Good
damage. The CTs mop up clean from
Vitality. This for has fallen flat for
the Falcons.
Okay, lead available
now. Zo's look alike happy with that
one.
And frustrations there for Nico. That's
the type of round with the rifles you
buy and you're lined up. You need that
first play to go to make that space.
That flash was too good. The support now
was great there to help Flames. He just
bottleneck them over towards the pop
[Applause]
position. Heat. Heat.
[Music]
[Applause]
Where's the air horn been? It's gotten
louder. I think he's got a Has it been
here the whole time? It's a fresh
canister.
Okay. New addition.
[Music]
Well, can you do baby shark?
Not even giving it a go. They're trying.
Baby
shark. There's one for the Desert Eagle.
A kick
in. Looking for economical damage with
these Desert Eagles. didn't want to roll
over and die on their
Glocks. Okay, there we have it. 8 to
[Applause]
7 edge the
lead. Obviously, AWP not available, so
he'll be operating with five
rifles. How does Kixon want to begin
this T-side campaign? That's the
question. in game leader leading by
example on dust two to drag them across
the line got clean once they were able
to get themselves into overtime instant
sandwiches in the air going to play
ahead of this now he's just going to
harass the
pop strong protocols kick is
investigating I was
holding yeah you'll be lucky to get away
with your life if you dare push the
smoke what control they want yeah it is
going to be into pop there if he's
tucked or not that remains to be seen in
he gets away. Combined with a molotov as
well and it's going to be a push. Oh
yeah, this is looking good. Mad
Vitality cooking some aggression. Magis
goes looking. Gets a jump scare. There's
more than that. Oh, and Nico swings in.
Flames. A double kill. That should
signify a ninth unless Monosky can get
active. Flames is given that AR. Robs
had already rotated towards outside. If
you have a player in that position, they
can make sure nobody goes B. But that's
been given up already. So, they need to
rejig this. You're not feeling too much
of a threat right now. You have a
two-man advantage. You can very easily.
Still have utility to work with. Just
want to make sure you've got your ducks
in a
row. Forced out of pop and now back. And
well, this one just feels like you're
going to go into the meat grinder,
doesn't it, Falcons? Certainly doesn't
look
good. Grouped up
main stacked on the bomb train.
Interesting adaptation.
35 flames tucks in cautious of the
flashes. One more frag and they can seal
their
deal. 20 seconds edging closer. Kicks
it. Okay. Bucks the trend. Combination
of Tessas. Need to get that bomb planted
soon. Buying time for it. Bomb needs to
be scooped up. Does so. Tess stands up.
Oh my goodness. He's made a round out of
this. Zyu can't get Monosy off of the
plant in time. Maybe the clutch is
available with Mony Crouch. Head shot
found. Upgrades to the AK-47. Zyu in the
building looking for he stands up.
Delivers. Oh yes, yes, yes to SAS. That
is what you want to see. Quad kill. One
HP in it as well. He's the man who made
the statement going into the halftime
break. And now that round felt like it
should have been done. That was a 5v3
advantage that came like a light breeze
on a summer's day.
What a turnaround. And you know what?
The two of them that died early. Nico
Majisk watching that transpire. Tessus,
he just stands. He doesn't play scared.
He had 34 points of health, right? Mony
goes down. You're not playing scared.
It's up against Zyo. You just jump on
the barrel and take the jewel.
It's a massive moment. Stunts the
progressions of Vitality.
They'll take the timeout. They'll have
the conversation. They'll let the
reality of that sink in.
[Applause]
This round right here could be very
telling. It's the remainder of this map.
Yeah. Both teams have got a higgledy
higgledy assortment of buys. Yeah. And
because we're so early on, only got into
around five second half loss bonus not
really established for either.
Apex a forward position. Nico imagine
going to try the same thing and not the
same result. Oh, little bit of team
damage, but the back of his captain's
head. Might have to play this situation
a little bit different. Oh, and more
aggression. Okay, well there is
different. You haven't just sat back,
not resting on your laurels. You're
continuing to take the fight to man
advantage again, but Tessus is still
alive.
asking a lot of them out.
So again, we find ourselves in a 5v3
situation again. You think there's no
way the Falcons can break back into
this. Util's there. Weapons two. Flamesy
low. Apex and
drops struggling for HP at this moment.
Pop control confirmed.
Apex in limbo. Two mines. Does he go
forward? Returns towards this Ebox
angle. Mony does have a molotov. That
will force a fight out of
Apex. Oh, he gets ahead of it. Uses that
smoke to his own. Gets away. Mony
however onto flames as he's tucked and
spam. Oh, it connects. Monosy red Apex
like a book. And he's got another a
quick one onto rocks. Do I not? Fracts
keep coming. Tessus finds me. Yes, I
will. Can't touch him. Quad kills on
quad kills. Tessus now. Modesty steps up
to be counted. Why does it look too
easy? It does you. Yeah, this is it.
These rounds cannot be losing. That's
two rounds consecutive fashion. You had
5v3 situations. You cannot be losing
those. I just spoke about the financial
ramifications. Those are more than
blunders. It just looks so easy as well.
My isolated. Where's the trades? the
multi kills coming against them. And it
looks like it's going to happen. Once
you've given them over the space, they
just walt out. They light you up. They
put their aim on
display. And it shouldn't be that
easy. Eco now for
Vitality. Four bodies up close to pub.
What are you meant to do in here? This
is a corridor of death. A corridor of
demise. Nico gets the information.
What are you meant to do with
that? Just on these pistols, you're
standing waiting for a re-swing.
How could she be reaching double digits
first? To each other, boys. Two run in a
row. No way, boys. Let's [ __ ] step up
now.
Valid crash out. That's a That's a fair
reaction to have. You cannot be losing
those rounds. Not in consecutive
fashion. Not with what's on the line.
When Falcons has just chock a block full
of individuals to pack a punch, as does
Vitality ranks drops. Oh, he go gets run
down. What's happening? This is not
supposed to be real. They only brought
in pistols. Now Kingston and Tess are
tossed with a crazy spray up to one man.
The captain HG looks good. Apex peaks
into it. There you go.
He gets what he asks for on the
economical. Sometimes you got to give
him tough love. Sometimes you got to
wake him up. Sometimes you got to remind
him what you're playing for. Robs goes
running with a 57, but then everything
collapses.
[Applause]
So this is it. Timing push onto Magis.
Nico gets dked. Flames finishes off.
He's pinned. Flushed in. They felt
rushed because of the flank from Robs.
And then Apex. Oh yeah, that one is
going to sting. That one's going to
leave a mark. Seeing both teams making
some really big errors in rounds that
they should be
converting by limited again. So this
just back and forth nature of this.
We're tied up
99. Both teams have had their mental
fortitude
tested. Presence Ivy now walk back
silently creeping their way through
white walls. Two players starting on B
for this defense. Apex and Robs and then
wait for this exeutor. Smoke a flash and
a molly. It will have to be absolutely
perfect. A spam damage
done. Brought down to about 60 points of
health. Execute lined up. We can see
which one this one's going.
Apex is going to get that first
contact. Flash might catch him. Tries to
throw up block utility just in the open.
A white screen and now face to black for
Apex. Watches on as Robs claws one back.
Removes Mony a valuable kill. It's Nico
scouts it another one required. A dig
found. It's up to another. Noop racks up
a double. And Tessus not the weapon he
wants for this sort of engagement. Maybe
the one D. Oh, he stabilizes his aim.
It's hard shots, long range, a couple
trimming the hair of Flamesy time. 16
seconds. Side was susceptible to the
body shot, so he is playing safe. Tess
picks himself up a nice bed, a valuable
weapon to use and utilize. 9 seconds.
Zyu will start to chase him down. Do
they run him down? Yes, they do. He's
punched in the car and Zyu gets there in
time. Impeccable
timing and shooting. 21 frags from Zyu.
Tessa still alive. I know the time's a
problem, but you're thinking he's going
to hit anything at the moment. This guy
has been extremely impactful for the
Falcons and Dust Duke now as well on
train. I mean the spread as well
involved. It's just so limited for the
execute as well. They only had a smoke,
a flash, and a molly. So you can only
constrict so many choke points on the
way back in. That means there's freedom
for Vitality to rotate in, make sure
that they're not getting the ground. And
right now Falcons are taking an eco.
Sure, there's deagles and a scout in the
mix, but they're going to have to hit
some bangers.
Yeah, Monosy goes one for one. He only
gets one. IU has a of his own. That's
something.
Nico head shot onto Mezi. Posted for
anyone that dares. Peak. A think about
it. Jump scare. Oh, he runs him down.
Stunning. Can't get away. Flames will
trade. They're keeping it competitive.
Kicks it. Yeah, hang on a second. Oh,
Zyu so nimble. Repositions. Hits his
shot. Hectic
communications. Attack from the scout as
well. Maybe Magic can finish off the
job. Starts to progress. A block smoke.
Do you disrespect it? Zyu hopes you do.
Gets it. Scout for your in a body shot
here. Zyu bleeding out. 11 HP. Flames.
Hey holds the line and Vitality up to
11. Ascending now. Backto back multi
kills from Zyu as he heads towards 13 in
regulation and Sonic hits his last
timeout. Moment of excitement there. Big
shots hit. Look out for Nico. That was
an absolute banger.
This is your last real chance to take a
swing at the king. At least as far as
train is concerned. Your loss bonus is
maxed out. You get the bomb down as a
minimum. AWP available from Monosy
again. Zu up to 24
kills. Honesty on the other side with
21. Tess says he's been the other most
impactful member. 18 for him.
[Music]
Can they close the door on this one?
You both too low. Two two boys. [ __ ] it.
We win like that, guys. [ __ ] it.
A chance for Falcons
to close the
gap. Nico, he wants to try something,
doesn't he? He's getting aggressive. W
pays a heavy blood sacrifice. Prime. Oh
my god. Three down, one magazine. He
doesn't see any of
them. Mezi, Mr.
Merryman, takes down
three. Job done. Round just began. We
haven't even talked about Rob's position
right now.
Oh, he slipped. Yeah, now Mony's been
spotted. Flames is active. Gets it
done. The round gets a whole lot easier
when one teammate sprays down three.
Just Okay.
thinking you miss it. That round's just
gone. Just over. I mean, Mezi doesn't
even know how he's done it. They just
lined up for him. I mean, it was three
different depths as well. There was one
in main. Nico was pushing the sandwich
smoke. He just lines up. There's Tessa's
first in main. Nico was pushing in the
last bullet finds Gixon. Crazy. Okay.
Well, the loss bonus was there. We can
get out some gills again on the Falcon
side of the servers. There's a couple of
Mac 10s. What are you meant to do about
that? Just sit back and take it.
Okay, Zyu actually a little bit of a mix
up in his or positioning but he fumbled
the movement and he goes down to a gal.
Shadow spotted. Nico flirting with the
aggression but doesn't want to concede
that early advantage. They've just
managed to take down Zyu and get an orb
into Monosy's hands. Okay,
can he make himself the difference
maker? Zu with a bit of a mistake there
giving a freebie over.
So plans can change for Falcons now as
he holds the line. Nico walks
[Applause]
up. Apex spotted out. Oh, on top of the
train. Flames can get away in time now.
Apex is in trouble. Covered by Mezi. An
important kill. Defends his captain.
They're starting to aggress. Oh,
isolation of the jewels. Apex racks up
two. Main neutralized the last two now.
Half health for Monacey in that pop in
that smoke. Utility gave Apex the
freedom. He was about to be swung upon
by Pop, but supportive util right now.
It is. Robs is rotating over. Could get
caught in transition. Apex the first man
on the
scene. Confirms the sight's unoccupied
for now. Want to see a Magic with the
pivot. Orbs a good weapon for this. Oh,
and Magisk already gives him the warning
sign. Monosy is alive. Apex routes
safely back around ensuring they can
approach this retake from multiple
angles. Moni focus focused on Con, but
Mezi and Apex already oiled. They're
already advancing. This is quicker than
they're ready for. I don't think Magisk
has even considered they need to already
be here. This is madness. Apex takes
home
train. A quad kill to finish it.
Frustrations hitting a fever pitch, but
they stabilize an eco victory and they
run it home to take the lead in the best
of five. One map stands between Team
Vitality and the ESL Grand Slam. They
are on the cusp of making
[Applause]
history. Is this the last map in
Melbourne? Let's find out.
[Applause]
[Music]
Vitality have had a lot of success in
the pistols. Five out of the six so
far. Looks like a bego from
Falcons. Smoking a couple of flashes.
Ross boosted up with the dual berettes.
Perfectly placed for destruction. Mezzi
to bait. Oh, this is a perfect setup.
Yeah, sure. Mezi gets goo, but are you
checking Robs? He stays composed. The
bounty tests, no problem. He gets his
two. As many kills as he had pistols.
And that Guji is converted upon. Down
goes Mezzi into the site. Comfortable.
Close towards the market window is
Kixson. Apex quite quick on his close of
the gap. Rocking that P2K. Still 10
bullets to frag. And Flames. Oh,
tracking. He got through that smoke,
used it to get out. It's Zyu partnered
up with him. Want to see a Nico though,
side by side. Well, this pair. Give them
that pistol.
Two clicks on the move. Final even a
little proud of that one. Yeah, give us
that one in the replay. What was that?
Okay, well, second pistol for the
Falcons and a necessary one. This map
was picked by them in the seeding match
throughout the group stage. 1613 went in
the favor of
Vitality. So there they got close but no
cigar by in from Vitality for ZYou.
Couple of SMGs 57 and a deagle for Robs
heavy mid. They're going to push forward
and fight for this Azi and Zoo. Yeah,
honestly he seems poised for that. He's
ready to receive. Staying active on the
angle kicks in as well lending a hand.
They pull full back. All right. Well,
they go for an early Lear and now they
drop back into what should be another
group up. You want to stay in transition
to trap these rifles as they go for map
control. Might be getting what they're
looking for in a moment's time. Window
smoke
lands as he postures forward. The whole
squad, but Nico is being held by Flames.
It's all about the timings here. That's
swings through. Does pre present the
first head. Wow. And adjust and controls
the spray. Flames beats out Nico. Now
his position is noted. And an AK
retrieved. Robs pushing the abs. Ooh
yeah, they're aware of the
possibilities. They look to pivot back
towards A. Magic hasn't taken any space
over towards A. He's still very deep in
palace. Honestly, and Kixon are going to
join them. So the three of them are
going to spread through the apartments
and look for fights on A. Now Robs is
calling top mid clear. He might want to
come through back cat. See if he can
find another pickup. There is a famus
available.
Flamesy has to stop them.
spots
them. Can he stop them? 25 as they drop
into the site. Allows them that. Oh,
what? That's Kixson. He has the bomb. He
gets brought low. Drops into the site. A
moment's rest by wide by the flame. Nice
shot from Monosy. Confirms Robs'
presence as well.
Potency. Yeah, I don't know. They are
pinned. Sure, but Robs,
he's not even giving it a look in. Okay.
Well, he isn't aware with all three
players. You can see how he's backing
off. He's worried about fights. Had no
idea that all of them were tucked over
towards default. Otherwise, that's a
shooting gallery. Maybe something that
Ross would have wanted to have a look
for. Flamesy did some decent damage to
all of them, but they're able to stick
the landing. They got chaotic there for
a moment. I imagine for Nico and Tess
watching that one go down. Nailbiting.
You see them get congregated. They're
grouped up. The AK could whip into a
head at any
moment. So, the force bite will get them
a gal. Robs can drop a deagle into the
next. They can have a couple of threats,
but this is a good start for Falcons.
The pistol and the conversion likely
turned into a third. We know that the
eco wos is what had their train spiral
out of control come off the tracks
and sure that left a mental mark as they
went outside to have that longer break
in the discussion. Oh, honestly.
Okay. Pip in the gam. That one's
debuted.
Yeah, he made his
mark on
Mirage in the Pug realms. Roaming
around, bopping heads now doing it to
deny Vitality and force us to a
fifth. Kilo's been given to Zyu has kept
the deagle. Zw starts up in the
vent.
Falcons be able to avoid this quite
easily if they just stick to their guns
right now, which is looking to be an A
execute.
Block smokes thrown out both on A and B
simultaneously. We'll have to b their
time, wait for the 20 seconds to pass.
They've got smokes available for the up
down. The flashes are in the mix and
there's plenty of mollies available,
too. They're starting to fade in a
moment. Here comes the execute. This
could bode very well for the Falcons if
they can pull off an XG. Don't get
disrupted by a swinging 57 like Flames
gives it a go. Apex on the site gets
found out. Nico can't handle to Zyu, but
quick trade from
Magisk. Job's
done. Last two pieces to find there.
Cowering behind that CT smoke. Hope
Summit gets given their way. Looks like
the spread won't quite catch Ticket.
Rob lives on. Any damage available. Any
kills will be great. Yeah, looks like
Kixson should be a dead man here. Oh, he
still takes one with
him.
Admirable. Job done. Okay, very very
good start here for Falcons heading into
the first rifle round of the CT side. Z
will immediately equip the AWP. The same
can be facilitated for Monosy, but what
does Kixon have in store for the
calls? A limited play pool means a
burden and a curse. Well, no, sorry.
It's a blessing and a curse. A burden
and a curse are two bad things. It's a
blessing and a curse. Yeah, you want the
good and the bad, right? And the fact
that you don't have the reps, you
haven't gone through a lot. You're still
teaching Monosy.
You can also be a bit more out of the
box. So you can be a bit more on the
fly,
which is when your opponent has loses
that advantage in having some degree of
understanding as to what your
preferences are. All right. Well, Rob's
not starting short. He's actually going
to be over towards A with Apex.
Strong arm on him. Chip away. Yeah, very
limited damage
as warp is now posted on B.
Interested to see how they approach
this. Tens of some
magisk through. Oh, bag on the
money. Zyu
poised. Not playing scared. Just dropped
off. That's what he wanted. Baits them
in. Throws out the smoke. And just
before it blooms, Tessus fate sealed.
Okay, so they don't do anything off the
back of that. They just reroute. 50
seconds
now. All through the underpass going
kicks in in
middle. You're going to go connected.
Hey, this is going to be
tough. Boost for the late arrival.
Flames going to have his attention drawn
shortly if Robs goes
down. Flash high. Oh, he's blind. He's
blind. He does some damage, but that's
an important find. Oh, look at that. A
flurry of rags. Nico's late arrival
finds two. Job done. Round one, the
first gun round is the Falcons. Okay,
that just happened from nowhere, didn't
it? Opening kill comes in. It's silent.
There's no information. There's no
noise. And then as soon as they get it,
they're all dead. So,
Falcons, the winning ways going early.
Going to be 40 as Mezi is just going to
have to save. No question about
[Applause]
that. Be a partial for the CTs.
had a weird flavor in this series. The
pace is a curious one.
Feels a bit stop start. These opening
killers give over and then on the other
side of the map there's not a lot of
control or chaos going down where trades
could be fought back for. They just
group up and they know that the
individuals they can hit those shots.
They can burst through on both the teams
having that in the playbook. Obviously
Vitality with the
advantages a whole lot more time
together.
So, what are they going to complement
this mezzi saved A1S with? Not too
concerned just yet. Vitality.
Maybe they'll take a tactical timeout
going into the next round just to
discuss their options going forward. And
that's if they can't get anything done
here. Still a couple of threats with the
max loss bonus in play. Yeah,
threatening indeed. And that saved M4,
but again, what year is it? Just X off
the rip. Well, Flame still has a smoke,
so he can use this to block or for a
safe haven. Here they come. Okay, using
it to extinguish, draw himself into a
smoke dome of sorts. Pushes out. Oh,
he's done well there. Apex chips in onto
Nico as well. Sight collapses. Mezi
behind the smoke, taking heavy LS down
to just 17 points of health. Rob
scarpers towards
CT. Tess is covered by the smoke. They
flash for the push. Rob's anticipating
them both. He's done very well there.
This one's on now. It is now. Yeah.
Flash of his own. Monosy ducking
sandwich. His teammate low. Mezzi.
Unlikely he gets anything more here. But
Monosy's going looking. Oh, he's got
him. Takes him down. Robs in the clutch
and he gets caught midair. Lovely find
there. Magis Monosy saddle up. Partner
up. Double kill each. Yeah, Flames did
well to get one kill considering that
situation. The extinguishing. Is my feet
going to be sticking out of the bottom
of this smoke? It was awkward. He gets
one. Apex chips in locked out of the
sight. Tesla's pushing through. Gives
away one. And then there's that timer
that I was talking about. Okay, as a
threatening round, there was partial
investment of the saved M4. All good.
Now, we're getting into the guns. Now,
we need to start putting some rounds on
the board. Do we really want to go to
the pressure moment of the fifth map of
this series? That's a question that you
have to be asking yourself if you're a
Vitality player on the server right now.
And that'll be Nuke. That'll be more of
this pace where they have control. The
default is going to look beautiful for
them. Just returning to that
playbook. The timings, right? It's going
to be harder for your analysts to look
for ways to be able to abuse or what to
expect, what to be ready for. So, right
now, this is going to be a bit of a
luxury for the likes of kicks and right
they get to do things how they see for
this matchup specifically, which can
help
counter
fight AWP. He's 8 and0. Remember how he
started this series? Like 0 and 7, 0 and
9, something crazy on Inferno. Now, the
antithesis of that
looking to tie us up and take us the
distance in this grand final.
Oh, that Naz going to expose him. Kicks
him. Was getting Oh, long that is quick.
Sets himself up for an opener. Zyu down.
Jobs are good.
And Flames falls back from his forward
position. And Tessus even goes down to
Mezzi on the spam. Okay, their hands
tied behind their back as they have to
operate without either of them. Two
untradable frags there for Vitality to
open the account. Is there more of that?
Maybe Nico's got some for us to chase
him with spam on the smoke. Get Zyu low.
Oh, this move. Yeah, he
does. Mind games nearly caught him on
the wall bang there. Zu strips out. Oh,
Nico. Just the one though. Magis thought
that might have been enough of a
distraction. Starts to walk up the ramp.
Goes
down. Pops in the smoke. 40 seconds for
this.
spam. Significant damage onto Apex.
Robco's looking. Oh, he wasn't ready for
both of them. 2v2. Bomb's not loose.
Yeah, we can't concede this. They do
have to prioritize that bomb. And Nico
has to prioritize staying alive.
So, scoop up the bomb. Nico goes towards
the B side of the map. You're going to
have to group up. No, I don't think he
can. He's actually going to try and sell
B. Apex is going to be in Mony's face.
Okay, so it's a 1 v one. Monosy, you
don't want to lose the bomb, so you go
Palace. Are you making noise? The
footsteps heard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Apex
has got him clocked. He knows what's up.
He knows what's up. Down goes the bar.
Down goes their hopes. It will be
Vitality's
first. Nico
helpless. Doesn't want to lose his AK
and Kev after the time. So Messi goes
walking looking. Nico survives. Gets
through. Okay, decent damage here. It's
going to be a tough fight for Vitality
now with only one player staying alive.
Z will get the AWP back. He can drop a
rifle across. Apex can buy himself one.
You have to prioritize. Do you want to
go for weaponry or utility on the
vitality side of the
server? Zonic, they lose a round. He
takes the time out. So wanting to make
an adjustment on the
attack just so 111. How many of those
kills were grouped up or tradable at
all? It didn't feel like any. And the
fact that Nico is just able to walk
through and isolate a couple of
them draws it back into another round
that Vitality really should never have
been looking at losing.
Apex had to get up their goat in that
train game after they had had two
back-to-back 5v3 losses. There's the
wrist breaker from Zyoop will clear up.
Look at the wrist straight down as
catches him at the bottom of the
scope. Kicks
in a smile on his face but I think venom
in his
mouth. Vitality will cobble this
together with fannes in lie of
M4s. No issue for Falcon.
Now they got a lot of space over towards
mid. Yeah, starting the orb short this
time with the mid focus from honesty and
kicks in. Double nades don't find too
much. Nothing at all.
Nico Tess is in through the underpass.
They want to go for a window boost and
get Nico for that late activation
again. Have to get past Zyu though as
the window smoke does land.
He takes investigating. Goes for a crazy
little spam there. Does give some info.
He's in the smoke. in the window. That
reload bought time and flames going
aggressive as well. Magis is very
passive on this.
Fight on multiple fronts about to go
down. Simultaneous jewels.
Magisk. This is not an angle that you'd
expect to be clearing. Perfectly
positioned as Flames does win his. Apex
pulled away. Nico gets back and now
perhaps into the back of Messi. Flames
knife out. Trying to pivot to lend a
hand. Robs task in Sandwich. He won't be
expected. He doesn't play this position.
He's the short player.
Flames making sure he is heard. His
position is noted. Does actually throw a
perfect molotov. Tessus will get away
though by the flames. He turns around
and finds Zyw. He thought he had him.
They're not clearing this. They won't
clear this. Robs on the FAMAS. A third
feels compulsory. He's being cleared.
Teslas wins out. One v2. What you got?
Mezzi. H grenade looking good. dunks on
Tess. Nico, what have you got? You have
nothing in the hands of the FAMAS. Mezi
closes out. Robs and Mezzi pull a second
for consecutive fashion for Vitality.
Just having that loose piece of rocks in
the right place at the right time. That
double right that completely changes the
round. They're not going to worry about
him. He's over towards B. Traditionally
they're taking down Zywood peering off
of K and Robs just delivers when he has
to. They're out mid fast. Giving it a
go. Relatively threatening. They're
definitely more so now. Monosy takes
down Zywood right at the start and Robs
already bleeding out as well. Messi
knows he has to make a play. Kickson.
Oh, he'll punish. Steps a foot out of
line and Kixson spanks him.
This CT side having a tough time keeping
it together right
now with a two-man
advantage. The best buy, but they've got
these openings and now they can just
group up. Enough utility to go for an A
finish. Flames actually gambling away.
This might be one of those classic safe
scenarios. You roll the dice. You go A
or B and hope that they come into the
den. Well, right now we can see Falcon's
maneuvering onto the other side of the
map. As soon as that bomb goes down,
there is absolutely no way in the world
Vitality going to contest for this. What
more can Kixon do? He's going to search.
He's going to play for
info. And there's some two players now
noted. Apex and they should just be able
to run into this site. You see them now
starting to accelerate. Have a good idea
that it should be open. Flamy floating
over. Apex pushing. Rob's low. I just
feel it has to be the safe.
So do they. Bomb has planted. Falcon
six.
[Applause]
Monosy definitely uh starting to show
his worth his way for gold. It's tough.
Apex going very far there, right? If he
goes down and lose that
AK 2400 lost into the next. So he's
actually just secured what should be at
least another rifle drop as long as
everybody stays alive.
So, keeping the threats available, uh,
team
vitality, when you reflect back to that
seeding match for the semis or the
quarters, fountains are able to pick up
seven rounds on their T-side. Right now,
they're on track for that and maybe a
couple of extras. So, going to be happy
to have guaranteed six so far. How much
more damage can they
[Applause]
do? Mezzi as the B anchor likely just to
operate with something light on. Oh,
we'll get a famus again.
Wow. Okay. Wow. Just a pixel there for
Monosy to work with. Zoo's head to the
back wall. And this one's beautiful from
Kixon. That's either being leveled up
44 or getting a two-man advant and then
convert on towards the other
side. Second timeout called now. Extra
head there. Just not happy with how
things are
unfolding. Falcons are hitting honestly.
11 and two. Eight for Nico. That's the
duo and their signature map just
unleashing fury right now. Now, if
you're Vitality, you know that you
managed five rounds last time on the CT
side. Still able to push the game back
into overtime and get the job
done. You'd be
believing in with a Mac 10. Look at him
for the tail. Back in the Apex days, he
always had these really nice pace change
calls. Nico's going to sell it to look
like a default in middle and I think
they're setting up for what should be a
B pop. Kick's going to lead the pack on
the Mac 10.
Nico will search out in
middle puff up his chest. Act bigger
than he is.
Rob's hitting a bench. They're actually
playing for this. Yeah,
interesting. Mezi's acting
solo. Kicks and tagged up.
Are they calling it off or are they just
setting up the execute? That's the
question.
Trying to beat an additional util out of
them, but CTS have thrown that quick
underhand. Okay. Well, they will
completely cancel plans. Nico just has
so much room and he's not being
harassed. He's been connected/ under
window this entire time. There's a
little bit land at his toes. The
reroute. Now they're out top middle.
They're using the space that Nico got.
Valuable asset with 60 seconds left. Cy
does have this HG flash combo. Swinging
with it. Ready is Magisk receives him.
Well, a short aggress looking good.
Destruction. Flames with two. There's
Robs. There's Mezzi. Falcons flounder.
Shut
down. What an aggressive CT side. They
just elect to bring the fight to them.
Zyu kicks up a fuss. Breaks open the
smoke. All eyes on window. And then
Short gets flashed out.
It's been a tough match around for
Vitality. Two previous they won with
only one surviving. That's what put them
in hot water soon as they lost. They're
having to bounce back and go for that
save. So, they make good on the hold of
rifles, but Falcons have already won a
round in this fashion. They didn't have
everything they needed, but they made it
work with the bodies and the shots. They
do it
again once more. Tessas and Nico in
through the underpass. Other three out
top mid. Nobody on the
[Applause]
extremities
procedural control. The boost. Oh, that
was a golden opportunity for
Nico. gets boosted up. Apex was unawares
but didn't find the head in time. Oh,
quick one back. How's he done that?
Tessa's just had that sixth
sense. Makes Apex dead
people. Imag back over towards A. It
looks like they likely see them push
their way up through connector. But look
at the ball of death for the CTs that
surrounds vent window and connector.
They're going to clamp down on this
together. They're going to do it again.
Signature Vitality reagress. How's it
working out this time? Mosy backs
himself. Good wolf. Good for one.
Getting swan. Flames down. Messy. Oh,
Zyu's too quick. Puts it onto Magis.
Late out. Ram. Bomb lost in enemy
territory. They heard him. They know
exactly where he's coming from. He's
smokes misbehaving. Using it as best he
can. Trying to isolate. Zyu takes it.
Gap is closing rapidly. That one means
an awful lot there for Vitality. They
have won four of the last five rounds of
play and that one breaks the money.
Falcons will not be able to go for that
type of a hodge podge buy with the AKs,
the Galils, the pistols. They're going
to have to take a bit of an eco and then
look for 75 before they go into the
halftime
break. That's why you see Vitality
letting out the RAW, keep giving their
eye on that
prize, making records this
year. Win here in the best of five would
extend their series record. They're
number three of all time at the moment
in Counterstrike. to make them 21,
cementing that and chasing down Liquid
at number
two. Can't stop talking about the ESL
Grand Slam, but that is what they're
here
for. Imagine if they get it done in
Melbourne and they still go to Dallas.
There's Cologne around the corner. They
win the major. They could be the top of
the pops and looking for a second in the
calendar year. That would be insane.
That would be insane.
[Applause]
And as far as win streaks go, no one's
going to touch that top spot. We can
forget about the nip record. No, that's
once upon a time. That's a fairy tale.
That's something that if you were there,
you can tell the legend. If not, let's
look at what Liquid were able to
achieve. 23. 23. Okay. So, currently
sitting on 20. Vitality consecutive
[Applause]
wins. Maybe the punish on that reload.
Yeah. Okay. It's the same base setup.
Robs on that bench position. He takes
first contact. Leaping in. Shouldn't be
any problems here and not at all. No
sweat even on the
[Applause]
brow. Falcon's not taking anything for
granted in this. trying to get the most
out of every single round. Betting out
that util, making sure the rebby are in
there, even though we're so late within
this first half of
play. It's been their final rifle round
before we head into the halftime break
before what dawns on one of these two
teams. Will we be tying things up 66?
Will Falcons be able to push us to the
fifth and deciding map of this
evening? We're starting window with the
AWP
posted. Smoke plumes. They can get
across towards the top mid box. He wants
to catch them and nobody has braved it
just yet.
Pixon gets across unscathed
again. Nikot Tessas the standard
pairing. So a lot of
default. What variation of a boost are
they looking for this
[Applause]
[Music]
time? Hip extended to the con.
[Applause]
Oh, that's a solid H to
Tess in the underpass and Eco smoke has
faded. Staying active, aware of the
potential for short as well. That
vulnerability tries to minimize it by
repositioning.
[Music]
[Applause]
going to be hit and then Nico plays for
the rotations. Pix going to come up.
Catwalk. It's a good angle for me, but
he has to have his eyes poised. It's a
tiny pixel gap and he does start to
engage. Bit of damage. Nico now spotted
as well. Under scrutiny as they start to
accelerate into the speed bomb site.
Mezi 10 bullets left. Does dispatch
a great efficiency into the second.
Quick burst to the face of Magisk and
this round crumbles down. And that is a
half Vitality can be proud of. They were
down but they are not out. 66 at the
half. It could all be theirs at the end
of
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Mirage. Terrorist.
[Music]
Counterterrorists
win.
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
Uh-huh. Okay. Come
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
on.
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
Heat. Heat.
[Applause]
[Music]
Yeah.
Heat.
[Applause]
Heat.
[Applause]
Heat. Heat
[Applause]
[Music]
up here.
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Is Mirage the last map in Melbourne?
Is this where it
ends? Oh, Falcon's got an opportunity to
take us to five. Vitality have been in
hot pursuit of this. Falcons have done
what no team has been able to do versus
Vitality. Take a map. And now the bar
set even higher. They must take two.
T-side for Vitality. Apex has called the
shots. Pressure at an all-time high for
Vitality. So close to achieving
greatness. Strong setup on A for this
defense. Util in the air. Here they
come. Yeah, they got Nico. They got
Mosi. No, they don't. Mezi takes him
straight out of the round. Up to Nico.
Up to Magis, but they aren't rushing.
Here we go. Second layer. Here comes the
flashes. Oh, already. A head shot found
me. Messi robotic. And Zyu just puts the
cherry on top.
That one to that tally. Mezi that was
sharp as hell. We've been talking about
the depth of this roster. Mezi the
supportive element. He has been putting
his aim on show, a star player in other
teams, but right now he is surrounded by
greatness and he is pulling
them. It's a massive pistol victory to
give Vitality the lead and it's going to
have to just be the force from Falcons.
This is where the game can get away from
them. This is where the reality can
start to sink in.
Instant onto Monosy. Yeah, just flush
them forward. Look, instant goo as well.
Perfect crosshair placement as you take
a bow. That was beautiful.
Starting heavy towards A yet again are
Falcons. They summon an extra man. Magis
Tesla Sneaker and Monosy just kicks in
on B. Looks like they are gambling
correctly. Got flames out towards the
island box in mid. Apex is with him on
the back of
Zyu by Mezi over towards the A ramp.
Robs to activate through palace. Son of
an investigation comes first. Oh, he's
getting tested. He's done well to get
the one. Keeps it level now by Tess
again. And just the pitter patter,
right? No immediate explosion, right? We
missed smoke. Oh, that might have
explained it actually. He wanted to get
the Mac 10 kind of edging towards that
smoke and pushing through it. Magisk and
his teammate Tess this Danish
duo on the a site. Change of plans,
maybe a window boost, get that Mac 10
ready to wreak some havoc. They're
rotating away. The gamble from the start
of the round was set on a after the
initial excursion and the one for one in
Palace. Maybe Kixon is reading them like
a book. Take a look at that radar.
Vitality now dropping back and Apex.
They haven't moved a muscle, but they're
in the pivot position. They're in
middle. They're picking their poison.
And right now it could be deadly.
You bang on. Kixon has been well ahead
of this. I think he knew Apex's call
before Apex did. Or do they stick to
their guns? Do they get skittish?
Because here they come. 20 seconds.
Okay, how does it start? Oh, it's like
that monumental head shot. Monosy
concerned about Shaw. More bodies
committing into the sight. There is that
soft player. Zyu low 10 HP and he needs
to get that bomb down. Good cover from
Mezzi. Finished off by Tess. Is the
time bomb down behind the smoke. Zyu
scrap of
HP extends the clock now favors
him. He's planted for short side. He
doesn't elect to go all the way. An off
angle for Tessus on his clears. Silent
approach. Su rounds the corner. Tessus
will put this together. He'll work it
out. Doesn't have a
kit. Doesn't have a clue. Doesn't have a
chance. Syu looking through walls. He's
done
him. It comes down to the one v one.
They were in the right place, but they
still can't get that right result. 10
seconds left. They're jumping out. That
kill from Monosy. You think that's it.
You think that slows them down. Kixon
even playing Joker over towards bench.
He grabs a kill as well and it's not
enough. This is Monosy. That's a
beautiful shot on Flamesy right there.
Kicks and activates in the chaos. Look
at the time. 10 seconds as this kill
comes in. Messi gets the trade. He
sticks the plant and Tessas cannot
believe that Zyu has backpedal towards
Short. It was a tough clutch. A very,
very tough clutch for Tessas.
He's humbled them. Take a look at what
Nico's in with. Kicks in. He's given his
star rifler Whoa. A weapon to make a
difference. Nico starting towards A with
a silenced
M4. There are some pistols in the mix.
Sure, but they are trying to fight tooth
and nail for every round. They are not
going to let Vitality take any of these
easy. They
know and one player survived. If they
can keep the economy low again, there's
still a chance that they can break back
into this game.
Late mid utils the call. This time it
lands.
Oh, a little boost could be perfect. Oh,
it is. The whole game plan, it works out
for Nico. Cost him greatly, though. It's
unlikely you see that multi kill. That
feels like it's a requirement. That just
walts in. Take him down. Unarmored
pistols collapse. Oh, shots. Needs a
second, but Nico so low. And that Nate
puts him lower. He is in jeopardy. Taken
out. Nico gets it done with that low HP
for another. does remove
Rob's kitchen sink thrown at him on CT.
Apex is low. If he can win a clean duel
against Zo, there's a real chance that
Nico could still win this. Or is he
going to consider the safe? Well, he's
hanging around for this moment. 12
bullets backing off towards B. That's
going to be the wrong call. The bomb
gets punched in on A. Now there's 40
seconds. Is he just going to save or is
he going to try and fight for this from
Shaw? I mean, yeah, if he gets anything,
he might. If anything presents
itself, Apex maneuvers back. Saiu sticks
around on sight and Nico not looking
like he's going to be giving this one
too much of a look in. Well, there you
see it. It's going to have to be the
safe. Okay. Well, he'll be able to drop
kicks in a rifle going into the next and
they'll get their full bolstered buy.
So, they gave it an attempt. They stayed
jarring. They took multiple scouts.
That's what they were looking for. So,
damage still
done, but the round will be one.
Vitality, they inch ever
closer. Round at a time.
[Music]
[Applause]
Terrorists win.
Melbourne. This might be the last half
of Counter Strike you get this weekend.
Let's give these players in the service
to remember.
Rifles are out. All for Monosy. Not
something we said within that first half
of play. It's still or die now for
Falcons. This is where the game needs to
heat up right here, right now. It's
going to get away from you so quick if
you don't convert
[Applause]
this. Mezi has been
[Applause]
[Music]
fantastic. And he's not alone on his
endeavor this time towards that bomb
[Applause]
site. Heavy burden on Kixon and Tessa's
shoulders
here. Their teammates are a country mile
away. Smoke lands. Vitality play through
this or do they wait? Tess can see his
indecision. There's that gap in middle
that they're so concerned about. Magic
just pushing palace now. I'm honestly
rotating over that space has allowed the
AWP to potentially get in position.
Smoke is going to be starting to fade on
the B site. The execute should be coming
through any moment now.
Robs waits for his Q. He'll be flashing
as well. Kicks and Tess and you're
right. Mony's here in time. Holds for
the line. It's the shot onto
Flames trying to get across. Trying to
get cheap key. Falcon stick around.
Double kill. Repel the invaders piece by
piece. Smellsy claws one back. Spots out
testus on the bench. Keeping through the
window. Chip damage on the nave. What?
He hit that faster than I could process.
Monosy is orb connects a second
[Applause]
time. Falcons take it. Mosy in the
server. This is what happens when you
combine Counter-Strike's most precise
weapon and its flashiest.
Where was that? Where was Zywood? I have
no idea. Where was Z? I actually don't
know.
Stunning. Smoke hasn't plumemed yet.
Flamesy jumping forward.
What?
That is
bananas. Okay. Well, said it was do or
die. Right now, they put themselves in a
strong position. Win this, break the
money, tie things up.
Vitality shove. They're forced by. They
go all in. They're heading towards
Monosy again. And he's on a here. Could
start off with an easy one. Jiggle not
going to connect. H could do that
damage. He feels the presence. He feels
the
pressure. Pacey now waiting for the
smokes. Trying to edge through trying to
find an angle. He's got something to
work with. And again, Zyu meets his fate
at the hands of the orb. Quick flash.
Mas activates. Light on ammo. He's
jiggling and wiggling. Apex just the
one, but this is surely a Falcon's
round. The job is done. The bomb picked
up.
Constellation prize a
plan. Triple swing held by Rob. Held by
Rob down and over. It's just Monosy.
Hits that shot. Puts it on to
Apex. Playing the fade. Looking for TS.
Isolating these jewels. Can he get away?
Turns tail. It's Mony versus Apex. All
to play for. This could determine the
outcome of
20 and N now for Mony.
The new addition, the superstar reunited
and lined it
up lightning fast. Got Zo in his back
pocket the last two rounds. Rob's almost
made that one
magic. But Monesty, he holds his nerve.
And the way he started this series, he
wasn't plugged in. But right now, he is
dialed in.
Nico's career has been a roller coaster
and he's on another one right now. Just
trying to keep himself in a crowd on
their feet. Partial, sorry, light
investment. Essentially the eco just
some upgraded pistols. Next round will
be the
buy. Falcons have given themselves the
best opportunity to tie things up 99.
Keep this a competitive affair.
All five rolling over
middle and the first will just be parted
in by Tess. Good nade. Little impact
from the Dane throughout this one. And
he's just going to keep on chipping
away. His aim. He's going to back it.
They can swing him at any moment.
Not shying away from this one. Now
Falcons Flames spots on that boost and
gets himself out of dodge.
Tess is not playing scared. the opposite
of that in fact
and punishes the walk up of Nzi. How
many more he going to get in this one?
Three already. Just two to find and
still both over towards middle. They
want to keep forcing their way in
through connected. Test is good to have
been getting himself an ace. No, it'll
be kicks in to grab one back and the
deleg is only good for one. So swept
under the rug. The eco dealt
with set sights once more onto the
rifles into the hands. Messy. How many
more times are you going to be able to
take down the big man on campus? Zoo.
That one v one from honesty against Apex
has meant that Falcons even with a
pretty clean eco victory are still in a
tough spot financially speaking. They
need this one to really liberate another
buy going forward. At least one with all
the
trimmings once he starts window smoked
off. Molly's over towards the island box
and maybe wants to keep on fighting into
the clear but not what he was looking
for. Apex, Mezy, and Robs as the
presence over towards A. That's
currently where the bomb resides. Flames
will be getting out towards mid. Ushered
in by that of Zyu. Apex does take a big
chunk of damage. He's down to 50 points
of health. So, a direct call. This isn't
a default. You're not waiting for
information or reactions. You're not
looking to jostle for mid. You're just
going to take it late. Wait for the
util. Now, the smoke's land. So, you're
figning it to make look like a standard
round. Maybe there's more bodies behind
this. Are you coming in through
underpass? No, you're starting to
trundle down middle. One on one on cat,
one down the guts.
It's a good angle for this. Tessus Zoom
unawares a rarity. Oh, he chases him
down. Tessa stuck around. Opening kill.
Oh, and Nico stands his ground
valiantly. Gets his on Con. Four on
four. He's open. He's open. Wide open.
Mezi's confirming it as we speak as
those flashes pass. Nico down. Perfect
from Mezzi for good response through the
smoke. Magis brings him down.
Z were very low on
con kept to play by the flames.
Magisk going to be Oh, he's going to get
burned out. He's going to get burned
down. What's Apex doing that for?
Holding the Molotov sitting in the open.
Punished by Magisk. Big frag. Big frag
up to Robs. He's not even giving it a
look. He's got no time for this unless
they fake it. They're just going to
stick it. Magic is going to fuse. Robs
are just going to save. There's no way
back into this one. And that's double
digits.
Apex sticking out like a sore thumb. Too
busy talking, not throwing. Well, maybe
he is because that one, that one hurts.
That one something he's going to be
replaying in his brain. Maybe the
assumption is that the Molly is
spreading in towards that corner. He
wants to get max efficiency out of the
Molotov. And that's just a man standing
in the open with a bottle of flames, a
freebie. The way back in, the door
swings open.
Oh yeah, that's it. He had no idea.
Absolutely no idea he could be deep in
jungle.
That's his last time out. Wait. Yeah,
he's going to be completely like hands
off unless Sonic pulls the
lever. This is the last chance the
Vitality coach gets a chance to chip
in. Four consecutive from Falcons. Just
when it started looking like this was
Vitality's Mirage to take tournament
Grand
Slam Falcons with four consecutive to
change the dialogue. That means max loss
bonus is in
play now to get a couple of investments
behind the save some pistols some util.
It's just going to continue to be a lot
of pack rolly a lot of 32 or 311 to come
out from Vitality.
So just looking for these direct
finishes as Robs the Grenadier throws
out the nades
again. Oh, window smoke has
missed. That's going to put a little bit
of info. They get that info safely. I
mean, that didn't cost them anyone's
life. You get at least confirmation that
you missed the window smoke. You can't
scale anymore. No longer a threat. So,
at this point, you are going to be a
whole lot more worried about the
extremities. A and B are on high alert.
Nico actually rotating over to bolster
this B defense. Man, he can float play
towards Ticket. He can worry about
connector from there. Magis can deal
with ramp and palace
intermittently. And if anything, reading
this situation is Kixon. Feels like they
have three players over towards B to
deal with this finish. A minute on the
clock, there's still room for Vitality
to change their mind. But at the moment,
feels like they have their sights set on
this.
Yeah, Nico, a prominent voice on CT
setups as well. If they get caught out
of position transitioning short, then it
will just be on Kixon.
Doesn't have any utility. He's just jump
spotting. Here they come. Okay, kicks
in. Anti flash supported by Tess. What a
shot from Messi. Plucked out of the sky.
Another one required, but the flank's
good, too. Look at him go. Look at him
go. Kick and Nico get the job done and
they extend their advantage. Two is all
they need. These are the gimmies if you
want to take it to Vitality. These are
the must converts. These are the rounds
they get away with against lesser teams,
against teams without so much
pedigree players in the server for
Falcons. Most of them have seen an awful
lot. You think about Nico, Mosy Majes.
Wow. Okay. Bit of a trophy
cabinet
SS and Kixon from different schools of
Counterstrike. They've had their moments
in the spotlight, too. Big round jab.
Apex on his war path. Gets across the
top.
Oh, destroyed. He did this on train as
well. There was a round that he just put
in the palm of his hand. He took it. He
got the venture. Even got them to follow
through. Can he do it again? Nico's gone
to no good as well. The guys are
headto-head right now.
Nico versus Mezzi. Oh, revealed the
angle. It's so favorable for me. Spots
his
backpack. Makes it a
two opening kills to nil.
Right now, it's about the finish for
Vitality. Do they send out a feeler?
Right. Does Messi head over towards B?
If they want to finish A, get that
information. See if it's clear. Take the
1 v one. Inform Apex for the finish.
Still lots of time on the clock. This
has happened very early as the bomb
transitioning back. Now, something we've
learned about Vitality is when they have
these advantages, they tend to not
squander them. They will take their
time right now. Oh, what a shot. Mezzi
again impressing these players playing
ahead of smoke plumes just getting
caught time and time again and that's
just going to have to secure the save.
Falcons even though you've got extra
cash to work with, you can't be going
for this one. This is a 5v2. Sure, you
won some 3v5s over there on train. That
was T- side. That's when you got the
opportunity to set the
tone. That one's worked out nicely.
Isolating kills all across the map.
Nico's one comes for free. He's getting
blindsided by Mezi. Not expecting him so
far down the stairs. And we've mentioned
it a couple of times, but Mezi is having
a great map. 21 kills in total right
now. And a lot of them have been
extremely impactful. Is Rob's going to
take it all? That's the next question on
the tip of the tongue. Looks like he's
got a good spot for it as they jump up
as they mantle up trying to save their
guns below you. He's overlooked him.
Monacey's orb now noted. And the hunt is
on to bring the fight.
Zyu pursuit of Monosy. Flames could
maybe jump up, bait the shot, pull the
crosshair away. Has that elevated angle
forces him away. Spots out Woo as well.
Down he goes. They lose it all. Mezzi
with huge impact for Vitality there.
This is a man that moves forward with
right
click. Does it his
way feels the pressure and calls what X
has allowed another 30 seconds.
It's a bit of a luxury right there for
the French
coach. They're in hot water right now.
Sure, it's just a one round game, but
they have to get through what will be
another buy available for that of the
Falcons. The money is there's AWP is not
missing. But at the very least, they put
a stop to the
streak. The pistol for conversions.
That's how Vitality started this half.
They bookended the five in a row that
Falcons were able to post. But can they
bounce straight back
in? That'll secure them 12. That'll
secure them overtime at a bare minimum.
Nuke map number five if we need to get
there. And damn, this one's going to be
down to the wire.
I have so much admiration for the fact
that Falcons are already this
competitive against a much more
established team, but to take him to
five maps, that would be such an
achievement in
itself. Close now. Big
round. Not able to find the utility
damage Vitality were looking for there.
The nes through to either punish the
window player to throw at that top mid
molly. didn't catch. Got in, got out and
able to rotate away. They are allowing
the mid control
over. Just take a look at the radar. You
can just see the gap that they're given.
You can have underpass. You can walk
through middle. That's fine. Nico's
really just going to be taking jiggles.
And you'll have to have a timer every
now and again to worry about that window
boost. It all comes down to
intuition as tucked in over towards a
magic making it look like they're
playing a retake a setup from Ticket.
And all the while Vitality getting this
control for free. N down the back
pocket. This happens an awful lot. Both
teams within the mid rounds landing some
very, very strong H
damage. Honestly on that B side and
they're coming up.
Cat, will Monosy once again feel the
feed? Zonic just called that time out.
Willing to set up adjustments work out.
It does for the opening and Monosy still
ready to rack up more. Nico even going
to be ready to activate. Swings on in
one and a half. Softened up. Kixson
overlooked. Mezi wasn't ready for
another
2v4 on the floor now.
Robs 12 is theirs. It's just Zyu with 15
seconds trying to bring his orb through.
He's got the bomb. He's got the orb, but
he's in the absolute worst position
right now. All the way forward in
connector. Just hoping they don't find
him. Hopefully they don't try and search
for this position. But guess what? Tess
is coming. Tess is coming. But hits the
shot. Gets away. brings it through.
Unless Oh, he's missed
it. The face of modesty says it all. He
knows how valuable that would have been
because now Zyu has his signature weapon
and Falcons have two more map
[Applause]
points. They had them on
[Applause]
Trey win.
The crowd wants one more map. Falcons
just need one more
round. Vitality need two strikes to take
us to overtime. They're into the
orb. They're staring down the barrel of
a map loss.
Can they do it cleanly this time or will
it require overtime once more? Again,
it's the pretty much same setup, right?
Tesla's playing over towards A. Magic's
playing ticket. Nico having to worry
about mid on his lonesome. The orb
starting over towards B. So Falcons are
running the almost exact same CT side
setup. Nico just worried this time at
least looking through the window. Not so
concerned with connector at least for
now. There'll be another nade
[Music]
[Applause]
exchange contingencies for either side.
So just giving away middle not giving
away any kills whatsoever. Waiting for
Vitality to have a clean
[Applause]
finish. Man seems aware. H could be
thrown at the right time. Apex starts to
unload low. Nico takes heavy licks down
to
61. Pressure starting to be felt though
by that clock. Robs and Tessus in a
standoff ramp
[Applause]
simultaneously. Falcons. If Nico can
just catch me here. Oh, he's already
given him an advantage. They got 30
seconds to rectify destruction again.
Tess on to Robs. He's still alive. Tucks
Tetris. Falcons are doing it. We're
going to have to beat all
five. Tenacious as
ever. This grand final is not done. It's
all to play for the grand slam. The
giant killer bonus. We'll find out on
map
[Applause]
five. End of this map. So for one final
time, Melbourne, count us in
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
The luck has changed in the pistols.
Falcons looking for another one.
Well positioned for this. Kicks in
support as well. Doesn't hit the head
shot. Policy does. Looking for another.
They're lining up for him. Gets his two.
Kickton gets away onto
Messi. Ram control conceded. It's a
deadly duo. Robs and Zyu. These are the
two you want in the
clutch. Down ramp towards B. Nobody's
rotated to the lower deck just yet. Nico
will investigate with Kixson leading the
way. They're in silently and they still
have this smoke to work with, but
they're hot on their tail.
Really concerned about that squeaky
door, which does
mean this is going to be a chance for
Nico. Rob's attention has been drawn
elsewhere. Tucked on Dark. Free frag
taps his head. Zyu up against it. Can he
come up? Clutch kicks him low as well. A
clean click. This 1v3 swiftly becomes a
battle of wits between the two of them.
Magic very late. the 10-second diffuse
ahead of
him. Surely he's got this. Oh no, Z was
doing it. Magis
stabilizes. All that hard work on Ram
could have been all for no, but
converted by Magis. A safe pair of hands
for the Falcons. Once teammates now
enemies, the pistol round converted.
Massive work as Zonic and Magis, former
members of Vitality, the ones who
brought the major glory alongside of Zyu
Apex looking to rewrite history today.
Nobody before, whether it was teams
taking on the likes of Arralis, Liquid,
FaZe, or Na'Vi have ever enacted the
giant killer
bonus. And those two affforementioned,
Zonic and Majest, they were the first to
ever win the ESL Grand
Slam become the first to ever trigger
that 100k
bounty. Will be the force off the back
of the plant. Gil's pistol upgrades.
Util the first smoke of potentially more
lands on Yard. Yanko touched on it. The
synergy will be there between Nico and
Monosy. They've been doing this for
years. New Jersey. Same duo.
Will he elect to spam? Oh, it doesn't
need to. If Mad just chips away, chips
in like that. Takes the head off of the
Nico. Oo, that smoke is so deep. He sees
it as an
invitation. This force bite flat on its
face. Just flames and robs. Both limping
and
dead. Majeski's looking determined.
Okay. Okay, Falcons. Look at all those
barbs just coming out of left, right,
and center. One through May. Magisk is
there. He's the ramp defender and Yanko
brought it up on the desk. Falcons
undefeated on this very map so far in
Melbourne. Nobody has even gotten double
digits against them. Sure, it was saw
game of Legion and Mouse, but you had to
take down mouse to get here. Put you in
this grand final to give you the
opportunity to lift this
trophy. And Vitality get blanked. Yeah,
this run has definitely put Falcons in
the the mouth of many when it comes to
conversations about who can take down
Vitality. They're demonstrating. Look at
him go. Magisk, he says, "No, I'll just
take the Julies, lads." Two frags. Apex
legs breaking, getting hunted. Oh, they
are just brute forcing
this. Ferocity on display from the
Falcons.
Mezzi will just be signing his death
warrant in a moment's time. That one was
quick. They're trying to catch a bit of
a timing. No tell with the door being
blown off. They just run out. And I
can't believe Magis with dual berettes
just sidelines him. He's he's playing
like a big game player right now. You
know, fifth map, best of five. This is
where he's doing his best work.
Alexa just run at them with pistols.
Yeah, this man might be able to catch
Depri with the major wins if Falcons
keep up this type of form with the lead
in. Talking around a month until the
major kicks off. The perfect time to
pick up Monosy. And there you have it.
Cherry on top three-0 starts
spotless now. Just picks up the M4 and
he could even drop an AWP. Monosy has
got his own money, but why not let him
spend and splurge to set you up because
this game is going to be won or lost
with the yard control. Sure, no head
armor, but still stylish with the
pistolers.
Didn't even get going. Guns will come
out though. We got what we paid for here
tonight, but Vitality being made to work
for their money.
been one map away before. You're one map
away
still. Those 13 rounds going to be hard
to come by as he posts up. Clear of the
smoke. Nobody
found something. Yeah, Kixson gets the
trade through the smoke. So, Apex kills
Nico jumping up. Kickson spams
through. We go one for one. Story of
this series.
gripping up ramp. Tess he has had some
magic moments. Tess test
did good angle for it. Dinks and drops.
See the helplessness on Sonic's face
watching these rounds transpire. He sees
the contact, looks for the reaction. All
he can hear is the calms. Not even the
in-game sound as kicks in burrows deep.
The wave back is treacherous now for
Vitality.
And Tess is ahead of the
play. Feels like Falcons already like
their rotations look tight. Monosy
holding for any heaven wrap hij jinks.
They start to descend lower. It's two
down on B right now. There is support.
Magis and Tessus the Danish duo. Is it
dynamite?
He's going to trifle with
Zyu spotted out. I just smoked off. The
molly's going to seal his fate. Gets
forced into the fight. Tries to stand
and bang. Can't get anything done.
Flames removes the defensive
element. He surge into the sight. Kicks
and throws out a flash to draw
attention. Does catch a bit of Oh, he's
actually got him blind. Beautiful little
sequence there. Time, time, time. Time
indeed. Got a plan. Got a plan. Got a
plan. Zoo too busy.
Doo. He's fumbled
it.
What? Bomb goes in.
Second too late. That's not like Zyw at
all.
Just lost track of the clock. The
harassment there from Kixon. And look at
this. Now the frustration starting to
grow. Yanko brought it up. It was a best
of five against Ma in Lisbon. It went
the distance, but Vitality were able to
get across the line. There is a whole
lot more at stake. Just not planted. The
coms aren't there. Too much to worry
about, too much to cover. and Vitality
the added pressure of being on the
precipice of the ESO ramp rush. Oh, me
hits a cracker and Monosy misses a
chance. Rotations there and quick. Two
players dropped down. Nico as well.
They're not falling for this. They are
going to be there in time to receive
them. Mezi, he's already gotten him in.
Can he get another one? What? How's he
done that? A miraculous second frag from
Mezzi.
Definitely getting the bomb down a bit
quicker this time.
as he gets chipped even further down
with that H. Maybe if it had connected
and finished him off, they might have
had a further look in. Kixon, he's still
investigating. How far does he go?
Just wants to see what he can find. If
anything comes his way, say a double
kill in control
[Applause]
room. Apex holds. Apex holds
strong and Vitality will find their
first T round. Eluding them for some
time, but on the
fifth they convert. Yeah, Mezi was
putting in a shift over there on Mirage.
It's top of the scoreboard for his team.
21 kills, 17 deaths. He was plus four,
1.24 raiding. It was the others lacking.
Flames couldn't really get it going.
That one ends up going by the wayside,
but entries in towards the B side will
secure there first. So, frustrations
from not getting the bomb down in time.
wiped away quite quickly. No dramas for
the Falcons by they can contest. We can
keep a competitive affair as we look to
go back and forth between these two
titans flashing. That is huge. Just the
catch right there. Tessus doesn't want a
bar of that. And yeah, he's doing a Nico
impression. Instantaneous for me. That
is quite the
shot. Save the piece on the
round. Aggressive yard control.
fancies his chances and not ready for
that but mid shot. Apex lucky to be
alive. Gets a second life. Oh, and even
spams at Monosy puts him on half health.
That's going to be unconfirmed damage.
We know that the rotation point was far
away, but they were blocked at ramp with
this smoke. So unable to brute force
through and try and isolate Tessus
again. It's given time for Monosy to
rotate back over. We might see the two
of them pair up and go for aggression or
one of them drop down and try and poke
their head up at Secret at a certain
point in this round.
Smoke redeploy. Squeaky blocked again.
So just ping ponging between the options
on Vitality and keeping them open. It's
the last really for that CT utility.
Just manages to get this block smoke
available. Messi on the roof with util
at the ready for a top pop.
Smoke for Zyu. He could smoke off
towards main and they can execute in
towards A as a pack. Here they come.
Flames the pointy end of the spear. Took
it to entry. Can't. Nico stands and
delivers. Messi through the wall. Gets
one back. Caugh by kicks in the heart.
There's magis. No ammo onto the USB.
Doesn't have time to reload. And he
still gets the head. They put Vitality
straight back down in the
dirt. This CT side is locking them out.
How often have we seen Vitality's T-side
or nuke waiver?
Interesting that they just execute like
that in towards the side right there
without really getting too much presence
rest across the map. So just push into
what is quite a hefty hold on a Nico
kicks it and Magis more than ready for
this. So beautiful shooting between the
three of them. Vitality buy back in but
right now a four round
lead. Back to making light work of this
easy. They have Vitality rattled. Nico
this time starting down secret.
Flow stay achieved.
Are these standard progressions? Are we
going to get the Y controller? We're
going to try and get in towards
Garage. Apex he's searching outside on
his lonesome. So MV gets cleared and off
timing. Obviously will bear down with
that AWP again. They're turtled up ready
for these Apops ready to rotate between
the sights. They're not fighting
yard gives Apex the freedom to do this.
Majisk has to fall back because of the
flames. Oh, and flames the first one not
looking. Oh, Magisk like a turret on the
defense. Monosy as well onto Apex.
There's so many bodies here. Good find
from Zyu back, but Monosy makes that
short live
off
rapid. How quickly have Falcons
accumulated this six round
hall. Seven rounds deep. Magis fifth map
top of the scoreboard. Yeah, he's had
some troubles throughout this series.
There's been criticism around his name,
but right now he is showing up in
buckets and spades. This man is
delivering huge impact right now. Such a
high pressure round and he doesn't look
phased at all. He gets his two and then
Monosy, he finishes off the job. This
that last one was naughty. Quick on the
repeat. Knows he's bolted it.
It's weird to say that the CT side is
working with momentum right now, but
they seem to be reading the plate very
astutely. Vitality will hedge back in
with a partial investment. The loss
bonus obviously playing into their favor
into the next. But this is where one of
their superstars, a Zyu arops, needs to
step up and be countered. Flames, he
just seems to be the lamp to the
slaughter right now. Entering into these
AX executes, just getting pipped at the
post. Nico already spots out Apex on the
cross. Oh, Tessa. He actually chooses to
play stick around. Changes his mind.
Drops out. Doesn't want to concede a
rifle. Never mind an opening
death. Honestly. Oh, quick adjustment.
Catches Apex on his walkabout. Oh,
that's going to change plans. If you
want to try and constrict heaven and
hell off the menu, Monosy's presence
will remove that possibility. You have
to get it done with bullets. You do not
have any utility vitality. You have a
pack of four. You have the bomb and the
stars need to start hitting shots right
here, right now. Who can they call upon?
Tess in the right place at the right
time with Nico close by.
Nico draws attention hoping to be
overlooked with Tess. Quick shot to
Mezzi. Traded by Zyu trying to fight for
control now.
Fake plan. Yeah. And now that door's
blown open. It's going to make it even
more vulnerable for a swing. Covered by
Zyu though. Threecoming single door.
Okay, that's not normal. It's going to
be a slaughter house.
Looking good for Vitality despite this
man
disadvantage. Turns the flash. Pushing
through. Good from Kixston. Oh, Messi
from Flames is all theirs. Another
Falcons round.
See nerves in the aim.
Tech9 the easiest to control right
there. But you're hoping to get a kill.
This pressure is mounting and it's
boiling over. We saw it earlier on in
the series. Apex frustrations. He even
used it to help spur them to an eco
victory on train that ended up winning
them the map and making sure that this
one went the distance.
[Applause]
If you missed the start of this series,
Inferno made it look like it was going
to be a quick day at the
office. Gold bars to be put in the
backpack on the plane and that flight
back to
Europe. 13-2 for Vitality. We then move
to Dust. An overtime affair. 16-2 for
Falcons. Vitality get the job done. 13-9
on Train and then
Mirage 13-10. There's those frustrations
that I'll remind you we started to see
as early as dust 2.
Okay, we got to lose. So, let's fight
guys. Don't Okay, we can do
it. After that, we can do it. Okay,
guys. Let's go for kick. Give up.
Playing not to lose. Xtask coach of
Vitality. He's identified the floor.
When there's so much available for the
win, you play not to lose. Falcons the
other side of that
coin. Nothing to lose, everything to
gain. You've got a great excuse. You've
added a player. You've had no time to
prag and you're in a grand finals versus
the world number
one. And it's working. Oh, TS. Okay.
Confirmation of presence on the yard.
Doesn't want to overextend cuz I was
watching. Waiting and profits. Well,
that's not the AWP. might help inform
that this is a different looking setup.
Honestly over towards ramp right now.
Nico from red pole looking for a fight.
That's the bomb. Taps away. Can't get it
done. Oh, he's in trouble now. The
swing's coming. Flamesy wants it. Wants
it. He's hungry for it. Take down Nico.
You've got the round. The flashes
connect. Flamesy will swing. Nico holds
on. Desperate for that frag. And now
Monosy chips in as well. Getting right
down to the hectic push. Kickst comes in
for one. Doesn't finish off the job. And
it's up to doing everything. They know
where Nico is and he's got the bomb.
They left it at his feet. Thank you very
much. Well, Robs, wait. He knows this.
Rob's alive. He pressed tab. He knows.
He knows what Robs will get him.
Zyu just did Zyu things to pull that
round across the line. Yeah, Flamesy
can't hit a shot to save his life right
now. He's having a real tough time. He's
in his head. He's a young gun as that's
going to force the time out right now
from Falcons. They need to be able to
piece this one together. Vitality,
because the game's gotten away from
them. It's a fine round gap. This is
Iowa with the opener. He delivers them
this. It was against the rifle. It
wasn't against the AWP. Easier of the
jewels. Honestly, Nico able to form a
bit of a sandwich right there in all the
chaos. And that's Flamesy not finishing
his
meal. You talk about everything to gain
here for Falcons. They can stop this win
streak. 20 consecutive series will stop
here. You will not get the opportunity
at Rivals to try and do better than Team
Liquid. everything that you have fought
for this fantastic start to the year and
does then that begin a downward spiral
over the next 30 plus days into the
major
vitality. You're the [ __ ] best team
in the world. I believe in you. You're
all [ __ ] insane. Let's [ __ ] go,
boys.
You got to prove it now.
Tell me Counter Strike's not a mental
game.
You can be in the lab, you can crack,
you can get the death match, you can do
the dry runs,
but who stays stable when it matters
most. Kicks in solid damage through the
smoke. It's unconfirmed, but Flames is
essentially a dead man walking. The
ghost of his former self. This shot. Oh
my god. Nico unloads his mag onto three.
There's the showstopper. That's the
round stopper. This one's done. Eight on
the board for Falcons imminent.
It's just that lingering 4 HP from the
kicks and spam. Flames has got nothing
and Falcons putting up a defense that
Vitality can't seem to touch. Zonic, big
smile on his face up against his former
team. It's been a tumultuous tenure for
Zonic in Falcons under an awful lot of
scrutiny and now he has two of the
strongest weapons in Counterstrike in
his team. That's what we had always
hoped for. That's what he had always
dreamed of and that's now what he's
working with. with Mony on 11 kills.
Nico up to nine. Magix has had some
great moments anchoring down towards
that top side and Kixson nine for him
has been able to chip
in. Vitality can only get four rounds on
this T-side and it's a ramp rush again.
Okay, it worked once not this time. Even
nearly finished off Syu as well. Moni
might stick around in the flames but
chooses better backs
away. How do they rotate
through? It's on that clock position. Oh
dear.
He gets away with murder. Zy was still
low. Flames as well partnered up. 2v5
each other. They're trapped.
Vitality left wanting once more.
Never before, never
before has a team slain the giant, taken
the bonus, denied a grand
slam, and a panic button hit. Emergency
meeting.
Three fields mandatory going into the
halftime break and that is all they can
get. 9 to2 the score reads. A timeout
taken. And this can't just be words of
support. This can't just be words to
rally the troops. This has to be
something to make the difference. These
late tops denied the ramp rush. Mezi
gave you something
miraculous. Yard control not
yoursy. And Nico shutting that down time
and time again. Tess as he was caught
switching and still gets his kill. Set
up on Nico as well. Draws attention to
the coms. Control control. Everyone's
looking the wrong way.
You see one team liberated by the moment
and the other burdened by exactly
that. More money than they know what to
do
with the opposite for Vitality. No AK
case. Galil's only Mac 10.
Last round. Don't even have util for
every single player. It's light on
three mandatory.
[Applause]
Apex has called a straight call. Page of
the strap book.
[Applause]
A fake into yard control. They want to
get this bomb down. Secret. Smokes a
fade. Fortunately, the orb isn't there
to cover this off. Yeah, pulls attention
away. He just about works it out. Gets
the info. The penny drops rotation down
the vents. It's a headto-head. Nico wins
out versus the woo. Flames with an eight
in his hand. Flames gets one from the
grave.
Oh, where that came from.
3v3. Mezi dips in. Apex profits. The
distraction. Catches Monosy in rotation
up the Oh, Magisk had his opportunity
versus Mezi. Turns around. Taken down.
Bomb's in the vent. Bomb's in the vent.
Bomb's in the vent. Bomb is in the vent.
Can't go down the fight. Can they get
down? How does Magic How does Tess play
this? Apex drops in. Gets away with it.
Scoops it up. Gets it out. Has to go
secret. Can't chase them up through the
smoke. Bomb's going to get planted. Robs
and Apex, they can set this one up. They
know where Tess was. They know what his
options are.
Tess impossible to get back in, but they
are sure smoke kit.
He's going to have to gamble on some
angles not being occupied. He can't
afford to clear it all. Smoke on the
bomb to cause a chaos.
doesn't want to worry about squeaky.
Flash and go. Waiting for an
overextension. Apex playing around that
smoke. Reveals his position. Tessus will
adjust. Not another. Robs, denies, and
secures three. It's not much, but it's
something to work with. Falcons four
away from slaying Vitality, denying a
grand
[Applause]
slam. Heat. Heat.
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Everybody.
America.
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
Yeah. Beautiful.
Okay. Heat.
[Music]
Heat.
Heat.
[Music]
[Applause]
Heat up here.
[Music]
[Music]
Heat. Heat.
[Applause]
Is this
reality? Is this real life?
Counter Strike history imminent
Melbourne.
Vitality came here with a point to
prove. Not a single map lost up until
the grand finals.
And Falcons changed that changed that in
a big
way. I know them. They did not they did
not prep this map that well.
Hey, Rash straight in. Got to watch out.
Magis is coming for you. And he's
determined, but so is Zyu. But down
mezzi too. He's so
consistent. In the absence of others,
it's Mezi that stepped up for Vitality.
A mustwin pistol
converted
counter. Time to rise to the
occasion. Show your greatness. If you
want to go down in the hall of the
legends of Counterstrike, a comeback
like this is one that'll be
remembered. You've been pushed. You've
been tested. And you talk about mezzi.
This rock for the team has stepped up
and given them something to work with
yet again. Pressured on that ace site.
It came fast. It came
furious. And they have to swap this one
away with ease.
Falcons the conservative of the
approach. No bomb going down. Equals a
Nico Deagle straight towards Ram to try
and find a
zinger. Honestly trying to put on a
show towards Maine. Will he get anything
for the Zeus investment or the flash?
Blinding fast, but not with the
weapon. Got a crossing agop that up. I
don't think he had head armor. Yeah, it
didn't sound like it. Yeah, that uh is
one way to give over an M4. Now it's
Flamesy's turn to drop down. Oh, he's
going to be ripping his hair out if this
gets any worse. Yeah, there's more
opportunity as well for damage now that
Nico Deagle is still in the server and
they have a lot of space towards
yard. Need to get that bomb across
somehow or
reroute misses another. There's a chance
to get close. Yeah, your departure is
held by that scout.
Oh, missed shot. Missed opportunity.
Forced to dip away. They're closing the
gap on the scout now. Running him down.
Maggie's humbled down to
16 down. That's another Glock kill.
This is supposed to be a gimme. Now the
pressure your heart
beating 30
seconds. So they try and find access to
the site. Flamesy calls. Secret
clear. Longrange burst of the MP9. No,
that's info though. They're wrapping
ramp. No one's down to be. He should be
able to get the bomb down and response
now. It's a great call. Flamesy heading
back down. Secret. Kixon's got the right
idea, man. 15 seconds, but they will get
that bomb down. They will extend the
clock. Magix passes that M4 to Nico
says, "I need you to hit a shot." Bursts
connecting. Robs active. Flames leaping.
Flurry of frags. The CTs
prevail. Hard work, but they get it
done. It's Flames and Robs that secure
it for Vitality. Should never be that
close. Falcons are now about to go into
the bite. They know that they could have
stolen that one away, but they really
never should have had an opportunity to
do so. That was just a deagle invested
in a Zeus. Here's the Glock kill and
Apex. Yeah, it doesn't look like any
head armor whatsoever. So, a couple of
goofs in this one. Go back to Mirage
getting idly by holding a Molotov.
Looking like a absolute tit. And this
time, no head armor getting swarmed by
Glocks. That has to be a miscom between
him and Zyu. How can they be so close
without Apex ready for that? Right. So,
right now you can tell that Vitality are
not at the top of their game. They need
to wheel themselves forward if they want
to get this done today. Sign of class is
not just winning on your A games,
getting it done on the B or the C.
Right now, Falcons are forcing you to
become your best.
Takes a lot of pressure to make
diamonds.
Ooh, Misk. That's a big opener. He's
just taking in for free. Just trying to
get on down the vent. Just move. Just
spam. Not even an opportunity to chip in
for this round. That's the yard
defender. Nico's going to take this
space. Yeah, trying to at least What is
that? What's he shooting at? I don't
even know. I think he just tried to
track the bullet. Track the Tracer.
Flames gets collateral.
Nice response from Zy, but they've lost
the ace sight. And you'd risk it all by
going for this. Do you really dare?
Yeah, you're just going to have to give
over 10 rounds. There's no way that you
can go for this. But how hungry are you
for these frags? If you rip this away,
kicks in knows exactly what that means.
What was that kill from Nico? I think
Mezi put like pulled the trigger and he
just reaction shoted into
uh Flamez. It's critical right now that
they hold on to this. They cannot give
these guns away. Falcons are not moving
at the moment. They're just making sure
they haven't gone fishing. They're not
going to try and come for this type of
round. These two big players for Zyuk
and Robs in the Vitality jersey. They
could win a round like this. So, Falcons
aren't going to take any chances. They
will secure the
10th and they won't even hunt. So,
retaining these guns, how problematic
can that
become? Apex can't be given away opening
deaths like that. And sure, he just gets
spammed through the smoke, but still
unable to contribute to the round.
Here's a name. That's your yard
defender. That
helps advise the decisions that are
going to be made and called upon.
Tactical timeout number three burnt. The
pressure it is palpable. You can feel it
in the
air.
Desperation. How can we find the
vitality? The one
Katavitza, one
EPL got through in Lisbon. Right now
they are absent. Or is this Falcons
really that good? One and a half days
worth of practice.
Monosy. Counter Strike's
finest. These teams know what having a
superstar like him in the server means.
Zu versus Monosy. Generational
clash. Nico Robs. The names. It's
stacked. It's like a movie post up
just
instantaneously. So
competitive and they're supposed to be
lacking
polish. Already shining bright
[Music]
though. Kixen talking through the
rounds. They know that there's an AWP.
How are you going to negate its
presence? Especially if the CTS are
lighter on UT will not have as many HS
to break. Well, Zyu and Apex currently
equipped with one a piece. There's the
first very early doesn't even get the
full clear which forces Zyu to throw one
out. So on the immediate plume of the
smokes, two H is expended. No
information garnered and that works
perfectly for Falcons. Yeah, info for
Falcons. You know, two towards the yard
side.
Eco loud on the cross. The rest not so
much. Brute force their way down and
lobby control is next on the plate. Zyu
and Rob's pushing
ramp and Hut. Nobody down to B. Yeah,
Rob's going to clear through lobby.
Magis is going to have a test here.
Oh, the three aim was there. He just
secondgued it for a moment. Ross will
profit. Here's the acceleration. They
have to go. They're coming, but they're
coming into
Zoo poised and ready to collect. He has
backup on the way as well. He hears that
Molly. He knows what that
means. Tessus taps the head of Robs. The
backup just immediately flatlined. Zyu
reveals him. Jump scare. Oh, kicks it.
Gets the bomb down. It's planted
on the top of his head. Nico Goomba
stomps.
[Applause]
Zyu has the audacity to go for a van
rotation this late into it. Waits for
Apex as well. Goes looking. Trade
available. Mosy gets away. Where's
Apex? They're not interested. They're
not going. They're going to give him
11. Falcons are two away from doing
what's never been done
before. And even Apex can't save his
gun. They're coming for you, Flames. You
better
run. They want to take it all away. your
hopes, your dreams of taking the ESL
Grand
Slam. Vitality aren't there right now.
The comms have to be at an alltime low.
How does Robs get caught from single
door? He thinks Zyu is watching it with
the AWP. He thinks he's picking up the
double door side. He just gets
blindsided. We'll catch it here. But
Robs is so worried about double door. He
thinks that Zyu's orb should be trained
on single. And then a moment, a moment
too late. Cannot deny the plant. Nico's
there. your pin dark. There is no way
out. There is no way forward and it has
just slipped through your fingers. You
will be force buying out the rest of
this game. They have shoved all in the
investment, the MP9's, the 57, the
scout. There's a tag, but you need a
miracle because T
says he's just ripped away the
opener. This one's done. Apex watching
through his fingers.
It will not be. You will not plunder
down under. The gold bars will not be in
the suitcase on the way
[Applause]
home. Nice shot. Messi dips away,
removes Monosy from the pack. Zyu spots
out yard
late. Bit of juggling here to ensure
that IK doesn't fall into enemy hands.
At least not easily.
Look how overcommitted they are to be
right now. Oh, you're right. So many
options available still. 40 seconds on
the clock.
Pushing through the smoke. Tes ready for
that.
He heard all those sound cues and
understandably tried to take some of
that space. Now Flames regretting his
decisions. How Zyu just cleared lobby
with the scout.
So much going on from behind. Kixson
makes a meal of that. Bob's going B.
Understandable. He knows where two of
the three are. It's just Flames, the
unknown entity. Kicks on to Rob Shaw.
Flames in. Oh, what the perfect
position. No one's looking. No one's
looking. TS just in
time. Has he got it in him? The bomb
will go down. A clutch that would have
to save
Vitality. Nico's low. Tessa's alive.
elevated position through the smoke. It
will be about tracking and reactions.
Good shot. Oh, the aim, the brain, the
game saves
them. That's the star moments that
Vitality are going to need all so much
more of. That just brings them up to six
mega
[Applause]
rounds. Tessa catching flames making him
look silly. Zyu knowing he has to do it
all. And on the tippy top of the site,
he sits him down. Four points a health.
That's a little summit. Summit.
You said it had to be the stars, Chad.
Well, there's one. That's
one. Who's
next? If that's not an inspiring moment,
if that doesn't give you what you need
to push. Still a smile on the face of
Robs. They were force buying out the
rest of the game. That was the plan.
That was the deal. That's still going to
be tough from here. You only had one man
survive. Means you going to have two
MP9s and a Fanas to meet the saved AK
and a drop them four. Okay, the buy is
still not great. Same can't be said for
Falcons essentially full. Sure, there's
Galils, but that's to make sure that
they have the utility.
Round 18, map
five. Mony tries an aggressive pick.
Warded off by the flame. Apex's not
being spammed in smoke in this round.
That means he actually gets to play.
Sees the smoke. Blocks it. Forces a gap
now. Gives him something to work
with. Utility dotted across yard. Nico
the point man.
He knows those smokes are
funny. Redeploy of smoke over towards
Squeaky. So buys them another 20 seconds
worth. Zyw with the last
smoke and sentry from Mezzi. Couple
flashes in a H. And there is a diffuse
kit in worst case scenario, but you need
a clean one right here, right now.
Vitality, you need at least three
players staying alive. You need to start
working on your funds. You need to rip
everything away if you want to be able
to inject life into this game.
Player caught a whiff.
All about Squeaky looking for a jewel.
Contact play.
One overextension. One misplay. Messi
forced away. His position noted. Magic
still focused on M. Back is turned.
There's Tess into the sight is Su. Apex
flattened. Tess a double. Zoo going to
be tested in the monolith. Goes down to
Kixson. Oh, he can't get both. Flames is
MP9. Chips in. Kickson versus Robs. No
idea where Robs is coming from. Knows
he's the ramp
player. 14 seconds kicks in. Have you
really got the audacity to go drop in?
10. Nine. Robs can just chase him. Run
him down. He can surely deny the plant
here. Five. Four. He hears him coming.
Hoping Robs overextends.
comes on clash and he just stands
up. That moment right there from
Kingston that'll put hair on your
chest. That will deny Team Vitality a
way back
in. Robs, he's supposed to be the
thinking man, but Kixson has the balls
to fake it out with 5 seconds left. And
Robs can't believe it. He's playing with
the buffer right now, Kixson. He knows
that they have the lead. He knows that
the pressure is on Vitality. And that's
a massive clutch. That's a captain's
clutch. And Nico's on his feet. Simple
bliss on the faces of Falcons. They can
almost taste it now. One round away from
rewriting history.
No team before has ever been able to
deny the ESL Grand Slam.
[Music]
It's theirs for the
taking. Just the 57 for Rock and he gets
good damage onto Mony as well. A head
shot onto Magis. Will this be the last
round? Will Magis get another round in
the server? Nico down. Big find from
Zyu. A man advantage. And look at the
health on Monosy.
Kixon and Tessa still alive. Both have
had massive impact throughout this
series. Don't forget Dust,
too. Two of them made a statement as
they do. Trundle silently down ramp.
Just one player here. That is going to
be Apex back of the side with a scout.
This is tough. Oh, he hits the body
shot. They know where he is. Can they
lead him out? They'll try their hardest,
but so will Apex hits it. Hits it. Apex
2. Tessus alone.
30 seconds and already the rotation's
here. He knows it. That 57's going to
chomp on him. Oh my god. He gets away
with it. The door's being played with
flames. No, not like this. No way. He
knows the rotation. Anticipates me as
he's coming from the ram side. Pivots up
to the top side. It's a race against the
clock. Up the ladder allowed. Planning
for heaven. He's planning for heaven.
Messi goes quiet. Gets the bomb in.
Tesa's not looking. Wrong way. 57
connects. And
Messi stonefaced as he does survive and
extend play. missed it on the cams in
game there. But Messi even took the
moment to spray the body before the
diffuse coming through. Bro, keeping it
cool. Bows them out for another round.
That was nearly the most tragic end to
Vitality attempting a comeback. Imagine
the kicks and clutch into that.
Apex does everything he could just to
scout back of the sight. He gets two.
Zyo looking the wrong way. Flames
promised him he had the doors covered.
And it's Mezzi just slinking up heaven.
Tessa is going to be replaying that
moment. Could I have planted
differently?
No time for those thoughts. We go into
round 20. It's live. Nothing consecutive
since the pistol with the conversion for
Vitality. They're going to need to go
straight if they want to make this 1212
into
OT. This is the team of the season so
far. These are the big boys. These are
the guys with the tiger on the back.
They're the ones who are currently the
favorites for the major and on a win
streak of epic proportions.
All that will come into the conversation
if Falcons can pick up just one more
round. How long can you hold them at
arms length?
Vitality. This is a different flavor.
Top split into main. Zyu perfect
position for
this. Back his turn. Misses up the first
couple. Trade from Nico's not imminent.
Sweeps past. Hang on. Magic into the top
side. Just the one he's getting overrun.
Never mind. He handles it. Monosy a 1G
and Nico alone. One V2. 19 points of
health. A single bullet from either of
those weapons would do. It would be
enough for another Vitality
round. Are they considering this sort of
relocation? He's got no idea where these
two are.
very diligent on all the clears. Clock
ticking away now. 30 seconds.
No HP, no bomb. How safe is he playing
this? He's just playing for the heaven
info. Yeah, but he'll be open to a
fight. Better be quick on his drop. Just
dropped away. Just dropped away if he
was to walk out now. Robs could be
exposed. Oh, gets his info. Drops
in. Retrieves that bomb. Takes it out.
Isolating Apex spots out. Knows where he
coming from. That's the name.
Okay, Vitality, you've survived. Well,
they bottle they bottomed out the bank
balance right now. Falcons will not be
able to buy. They are going to have to
take the eco. Maybe we see a deagle at
the absolute high end of
things. And when you're on the cusp of
picking up the victory in an upset
fashion, all that pressure that we were
talking about that rest heavier on the
shoulders of Vitality, that's gone
because you're the ones who are there
about to get the job done. That's just
amplified. That's just turned up.
Doesn't matter about anything else.
You're a competitor first. You want to
win. They do have one deagle. It's for
Nico who sustains significant damage to
that well placed HG
grenade. He's gone for the Zeus
again. We've had some crazy moments.
This one would have to be absolutely out
of the box. Oh yeah, he's clip farming
right now.
Get a moment to take our breath here in
the rod labor
arena. Had some absolute stinkers of
games throughout the playoffs. And
finally, the best of five grand final
delivering, going the distance, giving
us the action that we were looking
for. Lovely team play sets him up for
the fight. Nico removed. Apex finished
off what those nades started. Oh, okay.
Put on his ass. Apex sat down. Hello.
Good damage and yeah, finishes off the
job. Flames loves him some chaos.
bouncing around in Maine gets two.
The Majesty just a consolation prize it
seems.
Kicks in extremely low on HP. So, how
long will he make us wait? That's the
next question. The one that I've got
going into the next round. There can be
drops available for Apex, but will
flames want to upgrade into something a
little bit heftier, right? You know that
there's going to be AKs coming out.
Kicks are playing with the crowd.
Counterterrorists win. Is he playing
with his life? So, you're you're flimsy
right now. You have a lot of you still
have three rounds consecutive. you need
just to go to OT, right? Do you upgrade?
You know what? What are you looking for
here? Because if you have one player
surviving in one of these rounds and
then maybe you have to drop further down
the line, it looks like he's just going
to stick to his guns of that MP9. So,
he's not going to upgrade the weapon.
And he's even having a pretty tough map.
He's been able to get himself up to 14
kills. So, some struggling moments. The
eco bashes will help, but here we go.
Falcons. Another opportunity with the
rifles in hand.
Once the call kicks in, little bit of an
early main util implies a top pop
imminent.
Apex here undetected. Yeah, this is a
valuable early warning system. The
canary in the coal mine for Yard. You
hear Nico jumping. So information there.
Light smattering of damage from that HS.
I always puts a couple of bullets down
range. Apex overlooked. Oo, saves it.
Saves it, but traded. There's another
one. It's Zyu that keeps their head
above water. Everybody in yard still for
Falcons. And after that exchange, this
was an all in. They can hit the brakes
right now, but they do. They will have
to expend these smokes to get across.
Impromptu throne. So, the gap will be
punished. I would reposition up towards
heaven. Spams through, gets nothing.
Flames, he's the one rotating down
towards the B site.
Next point of assistance likely Robs
from Ram. Flint is just going to play
the jump spot. The safest possible way
to try and garner information down here.
This is still a winnable round for
Falcons.
Certainly. That's why Flames is playing
just for the
intel so they can
educate, manipulate their defense. Oh,
they could under it. Yeah, I think he's
going Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. But he's late
to the timing of this. That's true. He
might not be expecting Kixon so close so
soon. He's going to mantle up, try and
get to clock. Rob spotted. Ramp
rotation. Kicks and spotted. Rob's
noted. Worried about that flank on ramp
side as well. Doesn't exist, but he's
concerned.
15 seconds. The pressure on these three.
How on earth are they supposed to get
that bomb down? Not looking good now.
Rob six, but Monosy kicks and falls. And
Vitality sees
another six series
points. Now just two for the Falcons.
[Applause]
They had them in 11 to five. Zyu
happened. A massive clutch. A 1v3
situation dealing with Kixson picking up
an AK taking down Nico and Tess on the
lower side. The immediate response from
the Falcons to get their 12th. They're
up
12-6 now. It's only a two round
difference. About to become one. Team
Nade on Apex. Looks like he wants to
make his way down the vent. They've done
standard smoke wall and they're across
undetected. Apex. Oh, he nearly got
caught out there. Tessus is ahead of
this. And oh my god, he's gone down. A
catastrophe from Apex. And look at this.
Tessus knows what that means. He's
already seen so much forward momentum.
Robs has gone
too. Just the three of them. Tessus has
ignited Falcons into what could be the
last round of this grand final.
Eco's got his head in his sights.
They're closing the gap. Chip damage get
away. The clock is on their side now.
Zyu clawing back in. Can he get it
again? Can he save them again? It's just
sidearms for the most of them. Good
damage. Another falls kick. So what you
got? Nothing enough. It's just magisk.
They're on the diffuse. He can't stop
it. He can't get him off it. In the
smoke. He can't find it. We need
another. Oh my
goodness. Never certain. Always
guessing. Five consecutive rounds from
Vitality on the very verge of having
their dreams shattered in Melbourne.
Your heart has to stop in this moment.
Again, the coms are just not on point.
the fact that there's a player so close.
Apex has absolutely no idea that's a
possibility. It comes down to the wire
again. They're swarming in against these
pistols and they fortunately get across
the
line. Another opportunity for Falcons to
get it done, but once more it's a lesser
fight. It's not the allin and this is
what it's all about. Your heart stops in
that moment. For one team, it's sinking.
For one team, it's beating a million
miles a minute.
And either way, we have gone the
distance. 24 rounds required on Nuke,
[Music]
fully strapped, everything they want.
Both sides of the server. Eyes on those
stars to do what stars do in rounds like
this.
SP won't connect. Return of fire from
magics. Equivalent
exchange. Apex has got the
audacity to position
himself. This elevated angle on the
warehouse. And Nico did catch them. Did
he see him? He's talking an awful lot. I
don't know. He's not pre- aiming. Oh, in
the open. Apex, he's drawn blood. Nico
down. Are they really doing six
consecutive to OT? Looking good. Robs on
the ramp. Holds on. Forced out into the
fight. Mad should have him. Takes
another with him. Burns to a crisp, but
the damage is done. Robs's impact
reverberates on Ramp. Triple kill. Just
Majest now or all of that. Six
opportunities to win one round.
Squandered and survived by
Vitality. Flames. Oh, he opened the
doors. He sees it coming in. Flames
forces it. Vitality weather the storm.
We said they had to rise to the
occasion. If you want to go down as one
of the alltime greats. These are the
type of games that you have to win.
Under the bright lights of the Rodlaver
Arena, a champion of old is watching a
champion of new push falcons. And now
they are back in control. How often you
see Robs out of his seat just for
OT. It's a mental game at that point.
Six
consecutive
Falcons come into overtime starting to
forget what a successful round feels
like. Maybe they can change it with a
little pace pop. Here comes Tess Brute
force ferocity into the top
[Applause]
site. Bomb has been cleared.
12 and a halfk in overtime, but you lose
the sign so easy. How you meant to get
back into this? We can see the
HP oh so low for playing the long game.
Vitality worked hard to put themsel in
this position. Not going to squander it
with a couple of silly decisions.
[Music]
[Applause]
And you sit there and
wonder what if we called that in
regulation.
I'm not going to roll over. Falcons show
they still have the bite. Just the
pressure getting to them and it's really
been getting to Vitality throughout the
rest of the series. We finally leveled
out and found an equilibrium in that
regard.
So Shaw Falcons, they grab that one. and
get up to
13. Can that happen
[Applause]
again? Was the
[Applause]
opener. First smoke down. Nico looking
to take some space and accelerate behind
red.
The timing of it's perfect. He's going
to be ahead of the break. Oh, spotted at
least. Apex, he's not slowing down. Nico
doesn't hit the brakes.
Bent rotate. Madis catches one. Flame's
gone. That's a big jewel. Oh, Apex is
gone. Nico just wants to fight. Wants to
biff. Puts Apex in the dirt. You know
where Robs will
be. Hits the shot. Head removed. Another
one in the flames. No. Asking too much
this time.
Two consecutive I think. Okay. 2v3.
There's a chance. Oh. Oh. With Z you
messing with here, Tessus. You got to be
precise. You got to hit the head.
Now dead. Two on two. How is this 2v4
disintegrating before our very eyes?
Kicks in a monosy. The double dog. Mind
game. Smoke on the bomb as well. This is
going to get hectic. This is going to
get chaotic. Flash and
go. Swinging on through the switch.
Maybe they overlook him. What? They tag
it through the
comes down to that. Eight points of
health on the Brit. Mezzi prevails. The
stray bullet through the box hits the
tag and gets them the rounds. Counter
strikes a game at the smallest of
margins. And this one's going the
distance. Full comic book double take.
They're like, did I hear what I just
heard? A head shot through the dark box.
Who's pulled the trigger there? Mezi
must just throw a bullet out willy-nilly
does this. Yeah, it's a silence four,
isn't it? Yeah. Peppers him through it.
Honestly, almost gets it done regardless
and then has to find that bomb. Has to
get on the diffuse and still fired up.
That was a tough round to get back into.
Another 5v3 situation slips by the
wayside. We're going to get headto-head
early here. Apex lots of opening deaths.
these last
few and again back turned Nico
instantaneous deletion of Vitality's
captain. That's the opening kill they
need to leave with a lead on this T-side
site. Flames puts his head in the vice.
Tested traded. Tessus into the sight.
It's me and Zyu to be I was going to say
tested. They hit the brakes
understandably. So you've got yourself
the man advantage.
A signature Falcon's pause. Zyu
investigates. Oh, and he comes up. Trump
finds out. Monosy in scrutiny. 50
damage. Solid nade. Softens him
up. Justice has slipped
by. Could activate late, come up and
potentially catch one. Yeah. Back turns.
I down. Number advantage.
Awkward now for Robs. He doesn't know
whether he should be chasing Tessus or
is Tessus going to come to
him. 26 Frag Hall. Tessus with a
superstar performance. And he's got
Y. No, he doesn't. Props out. Messi
overlooked. It falls to
Magisk to do what Kixson
couldn't in this one. At
least Tess has got him this close now
with B round. He gets the job done.
Mezzi walking up on him, closing that
gap rapidly. Magis in so much trouble
under so much scrutiny. Mezi from the
behind. Going to swing out. Isolates the
jewel. Magis with the adjustment. Big
game player
Magisk when everything matters. Every
decision you make like this one made by
Rob. Magic. It's Rob's round. Only two
kills, but they are magnificent. Both
jewels. He is not favored. He leaves
with the round. Apex doesn't believe
what he is witnessing right now. This
man giving up opening kills left, right,
and center. Watches on Biden his nails.
And how does Robs win out these fights?
The shadow betray Tess there. Second
flash is perfect. Keeps Robs completely
blind. Mean that he can't scale up and
swing out to look for the trade. Goes to
sit it and still catches the fight.
We're talking about the
superstars. We swap sides.
16. The magic number. 15. We do it all
again. Straight into the
call. Apex's game plan to be realized. A
split. Yeah. Straight through
main. Kicks and hit by the molly. Know
he's around there somewhere. Hidden in
the smoke. Majes. Majes. Double kill.
Kicks and one as well.
Vitality short on
players and a quick CT round to start to
level us up to tie us
up just the woo nothing he can
[Applause]
do 14 each I can't believe they went
back to testing that a site remember how
this map started vitality on the T-side
a couple of their early gun rounds I
think it was even back to back they
tried to do these executes in towards A
to isolate magis and he stepped up he
multiple multi- kills and they've gone
for that again. XTAS maybe noting
exactly that. Hey, why are we returning
to that if that was part of the game
plan? It didn't
work. But also, let's leave Magisk alone
right now. He's having a game.
27 kills for Tennis. 20 for Magis. 18 a
piece for Nico Mony 17 for Kixon.
Impeccable timing for Madis. He just
knows what those sound cues mean. It
just looks too comfortable on this top
defense.
I don't think he can go for that type of
play again.
Another time out called. So yeah, that
was XAZ, I think, wanting to make sure
that they don't call into a similar type
of round. You don't want to let Falcons
get up to 15 first.
Well, this is the one to slightly
alleviate that pressure gauge. You get
this, you guarantee double OT at a
minimum. You can play your final round
of overtime liberated by that.
Monty tried a touch of
aggression for such a momentous
occasion. And Zyu already posted on that
exact
fight, takes down his
rival for his 26th contribution on Nuke.
Smokes are fading. The bomb will need to
be picked up at some point for Vitality.
Someone will be tasked with going back
and picking that up, I'm sure.
Does the moment get the better of them
aggression
versus Tess wins it out back to back in
the headto-head. If Nico keeps going,
he'll find the bomb. Oh, not if Apex
gets to it first. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh my god.
He's going to lose the bomb. Nico's
going to put the bomb on the Oh, head
shot found. Awkward now. Zyu, how do you
pick this up? How do you play this? What
can you do? Knife out. Turn around. Gets
out. No, he doesn't. Nico's there. Mezi
distracted. Kicks and
profits. Flames and Robs. Robs returns
to lobby, but it feels like they've lost
this one. Slipping away. 15 first for
Falcons. Nico's aggression catching apex
and it all falls apart. There's no way.
You're not clearing this. You're not
ready.
15 is theirs. Will the seventh time be
the last time here in Melbourne. Seventh
series point.
That little situation right there might
seem like nothing. The fact he has to go
back to pick up the bomb. There's a gap
available. Sure, that had to be the one
gap pushed on that perfect timing. Tiny.
There's only one in a million that that
happens. It did. But those are the
moments that will keep you up at night,
especially with what Vitality were on
the cusp of
achieving. Apex says he has no regrets.
Well, maybe nobody having in the bomb
might become one of them. You got your
Cologne, you got your Katavitza, you got
your
majors. You don't have a ESL Grand Slam
under your
belt. And of all the characters in this
cast of
teams, it's
Falcons. This
unification of Counter-Strike
muscle to play spoiler. And again, this
could be the last round.
Melbourne, have Vitality got it in them
to take us to a double overtime?
Nika starting down secret this time
round. Ready to receive the
[Applause]
Frenchman across undetected but sound
Q's potentially
heard. Nico playing defensive. Apex on
the jiggle spots it now. Exchange of
utility to block for now. Drops the
smoke as well. He doesn't want any
trouble.
Rest of the pack currently poised if
they get the space to pounce on Tess.
Honesty hedging over to fortify ramp
right now. This kid could be worth every
penny if they shut this down.
He was brought on this team for one
reason, Chad, and that was trophies.
This is perfect.
And that trophy could be theirs in less
than 45 seconds.
with an extra 100 grand on top. It's
Nico that takes the head off of Apex.
Mosy finds Flames. They both fill the
feed. Tess is coming back up. Thinking
about it. Certainly flirting with the
idea, but you have that man advantage.
Vitality, the pressure is on them. The
pressure is on them. A little relieved
now as Tess gets overrun. Zyu strings
together a double. This high pressure
round falling apart at the seams. Magic
indecisive. How does he play it? The
bomb goes down. Robs hits the shot.
We're going again. One more
required leak of a modesty chip in, but
it's still not enough. This game will
not end. Not on Vitality's watch, not on
Zyu and Rob's watch. Another overtime
secured. This man right here in the
center of your screen. This is one of
the best players to ever touch the game.
That's why he's got the name.
We wouldn't be here without that clutch.
back-to- back world number on's one of
the absolute great and in a pressure
game. At points in his career, he has
been criticized for not stepping up.
Well, do that right now. See what output
that he has put in to this fifth and
deciding map with the most on the line.
I mean, this is what happens when you
put great in the server and make them
fight. You end up in a double overtime.
Who wants it more?
Who's got the gas in the tank to take
him that extra mile? But that volley
well placed this time. He's just going
to burn out. He'll try and take one with
him. Gets away with it.
That was supposed to be a free frag
instead. Nico makes it costly. The one v
one you're looking for.
Apex will take consolation at this
point. He can't even buy a kill. Z was
gone. That's a very big frag from Kixon
to post.
out of the round.
They once again ask questions of Magisk
top site. Did they not receive the memo?
It is
closed. Not this time. Flames takes him
down. Huge double kill to
rectify. Advantage
squandered. Honestly
delayed. Tessus joins him.
Bomb has planted.
Flash and go.
Likely Robs and
Flamesy with the bomb on their side.
Uncertainty though. Still not sure as to
where they both are. Now gets the info.
Think he spots
two. That'll fade. They're going to have
to swing eventually. Tess gets himself
out. Loses his head. Robs makes him
dead. Monosy. An impossible clutch.
Flames up close on Hut. Holds the angle.
Oh. Oh, he hits that shot.
Crazy. Important double there from
Flamesy to break in towards that a
site. And that shot from
Odyssey. Here it is
again. Need Apex to somehow reenter
himself because at the moment he's
mental. Well, no, he is mental. The
mental game. That's the part and parcel
of this that is really running him for
loops. He needs to be focusing on that
crosshair. Tough for an in-game leaders
to do, especially in this pressure
environment. He's got his players to
play, but if he could help them out with
a kill or two. Oh, it's a missed smoke
by the looks of
things. Bit premature on the H. No one
home. Instantaneous second. Okay, that's
a good green light for Apex to try and
get across. Flash does assist and he
gets up down to the secret stairs. Okay,
this time with a whole lot more of an
open runway. The resistance is not
there. The instant molly, the instant
smoke. Eco hasn't addressed it just yet.
Someone else will have to dip down and
that man will have to be
Tessus. He's playing on the ramp for
now. Door opens. A window smashed. Are
they going to try something a little bit
cheeky? Break a window as he opens the
door. Have a distraction towards top so
they don't hear this. That's the
question. Yeah, he just looked up. I
think he's trying to talk to them. There
you go. Now he swung open the door. So
undetected to make this play on this
stage. This is crazy. There's no way.
There's no way you have the presence of
mind to call for that. And Tess is about
to get
clothesline. Jump scare. Oh my god. He
has to have it. Lee
just about. Got to get past the orb. Oh
wow. Quick one back. Anti flash flicks
on back but Apex brings him down again.
You want some frags from Apex? Chad
House too.
Nico though still alive and partnered up
with Magisk. Repels the invaders from
top site. Ross is calling it clear.
Everybody rotated B for Falcons. The
only way back through is going to be
Secrets up the ladder. He can plant safe
Heavenside. Zoe having a smoke for main.
They should lock them out with this.
They're in trouble. Falcons. How you get
through this? It's going to be flash and
go. Bleak. Not how you want to be
approaching. Nico considering an
alternate option. And Mezi is too.
Time's going to become the issue. If you
take too long, you can't flood the
movement. Very late.
They'll double swing him though. Messi
tight on the angle. Concerned about the
ladder as well. Gets the Oh, gets them
both.
Vitality a 17th in the
bag. And Apex a crucial role within that
round. I still can't believe the type of
plays that he's gone for. Think about
the last round of regulation. I'm pretty
sure it was. He's sitting top of
warehouse now here in front of a packed
arena. He's attempting to make a play
that requires sound right now.
Obviously, you're helped out by the fact
of that, but you're hoping you're not
giving away as you're making this lurk.
And almost, oh my gosh, dropping the
ball on that one. Not a head shot, not
clean, but still the kill and found the
double. But right now, Falcons are in
trouble. Kicks it into an SMG. Rifles
for the rest. Couple of kits. Head armor
lacking. Not going to be a problem
against these AK-47s. Clei on the T-side
would be incredible. You need something,
Falcons. And that's a start.
[Applause]
Apex hemorrhaging his eight opening
deck. Robs up to no good. This is a
classic Robs move out the door.
Waits for the reaction. Mag just
anticipates his play and sits there
waiting. No way.
Welcome to double overtime. Welcome to
double overtime. No. No. No. No way. He
put away the knife. He had the read. He
had the play. The one time you want to
bring a knife to a gunfight and you get
stuck with an aid in your hand. Oh no,
I've never seen that before. He had
everything going for him and then swaps
to an M4. Now Gixson, lots of bodies.
Not clearing. Mezzi, he overlooked the
possibility. Nico doing everything in
his power. He gets two. Two on
two, but this is Robson Dyu.
Bomb has been planted and Monosy going
for that lobby.
Rab Zoo left on the site. Robs tucks
vent doesn't go off the flash. Just
trying to draw attention to his heaven
push. Zou is not distracted. He's not
falling for their silly
games. Honesty doesn't hit the quick
scope. Robs does. Removes Tess from
heaven. No chance from Odyssey. Perfect.
Perfection. All three from Vitality's
T-side. They are now one away. Those
dreams we thought were going to be left
ripped and in tatters are once again
bubbling up inside of them. But now the
pressure it changes once more. Three
swings, three cracks, three
opportunities.
[Music]
Right now, get in their face. Go for a
lobby crunch. Take some risks. Take some
challenges. Get outside of the box. You
are finally in control of
Nuke. Challenge accepted. First half
felt like this could have been a
blowout. Clutches required. Grit,
determination, and vitality being
discussed. How good can this team be?
[Music]
Just one more
round. They have dug themselves out of a
deep
hole. Six consecutive rounds just for
OT. Another
OT and now 19. The magic number. Three
stabs. One single round.
Guess it's getting tricky with it.
Strafes on over. Brings the fight. Apex
ready. Oh, can't
convert. That's blood drawn. Zyu
occupying that secret
push. Anticipating kicks
in. Nico. Oh, it's Nico. Nico versus the
Woo. AKB. He jiggles him out. Confirms
his presence. That's info. Now you can
spread yard. You can try and get over
towards hell. Tessus is already there.
This is perfect for a top split. Z's
pushing. What? What? What? What? Z's
pushing. He does it. An unbelievable
aggress. Tessus does continue to
impress. Finding another of the ladder.
Robs. What's that for? The bomb's loose
in yard. 50 seconds.
It's just Saiw. They know exactly where
you
are. Their first attempt of the three
has fallen by the wayside. Just Monosy a
casualty of the skirmish. Feels like
they're bullying Apex over towards Yard
at the moment.
Zyu having to make a crazy play just to
make it interesting. Robs attempting to
do one of his own. Not expecting just to
hang around for that. Zu will grab
another. Doesn't look like he wants to
save this AWP. However,
It's been so interesting to see the
shifting
pressures as soon as you find
yourself on the precipice of victory.
We've seen it from Falcons. We've seen
it from
[Applause]
Vitality. Two more attempts.
Two more rounds. Falcons cannot afford
to lose. Do you go for a yard control
right now? They're taking a time out to
have that conversation. So if Outside's
being bullied, if Apex is being
isolated, let's give them a lot of
support. Let's do a yard control. Let's
push up towards red. Let's get close.
Let's just snuff them out. And if we
can, we can win that duel. It's done.
They have no control. But what could the
call be? Falcons haven't had any issues
doing top hits. They've been able to
brute force in. They've shown that they
actually can pull that off. something
that Vitality have not been able to
achieve. So, it's a question
of do we count on Apex and Yard? Do we
invest our resources there? Do we leave
our top site vulnerable that's already
been
exploited? A decision that could be
worth a million dollars. Double orbs was
an option. It was available. Could have
given one to Robs. Could it down a ramp,
you know, have the orb and a rifle
outside, two rifles on top side, but
they're just going to play it by the
book. Keeping a standard right now.
Thanks, Taz.
gives them 30 seconds to talk through
the next motions, the next minute and
55. Gloria waits or does
it? Nico spotted him. Information
exchanged. Smoke wall
[Applause]
lands. Oh, he hits him straight through
the box.
Throwback to Inferno that feels like
another year
ago and go. Nico avoids the spam, gets
himself across. He's going to rotate
down right now. It appears to be Flames.
Rob's also cheating under. Seen Flames
with this one
before. Z playing with the orb towards
CT. So might be able to catch them in
transition if they come back out of
secret.
Bombs in lobby. Apex now picking up the
mantle of the ramp hold. Leaving all the
pressure on mezi on a he has been a rock
when
tested. 45 seconds the go signal will
have to come. Monosy on the x-ray ready
to throw util top side. Are they
splitting a? It looks like it. Seems
like that's the plan. Zoo just falls
away from that. So now Tess less
vulnerable. Mezzi has help. The backup's
arrived. 30 seconds. Here comes the
finish. Down goes Flames. Nico gets his
into the top side though. Z's missed his
chance. Messi, can you hold? Oh, he
can't. Down they go. And it's a Falcons
round. Both teams looking to go flawless
on their T- sides of OT number
two. Can you believe what we're
witnessing here this evening?
The universe has a way of balancing
things out. Melbourne being given a gift
in this grand
final. Just desperation from Robs comes
on the vent does well to get one, but
otherwise Falcons now coming to play
today. This is some class Counter-Strike
on
display. No or this time round. Zywood
will have to wield a rifle instead.
still have everything they need to
Vitality. Very heavy investment of
bodies towards Yard. Make it all
five. Tesla's just up on the silo trying
to
oversee. Apex peppering away through the
smoke. The reload. They'll cross. Robson
Z were going to push lobby.
I get early information if they continue
with this. As soon as lobby's called
clear, you'll have a very good
understanding that this is everybody
down. Secret Apex just him careful with
the movements. A flash maybe forces some
fire. Not the case. Tesla now selling
outside. Aim map smokes. Apex jump.
Spots
it. Spots out. Nico repositions. Bomb's
coming down. Be begging for a rotation.
Nico's got the ven rotate cut off. Kicks
and advancing.
And Tess is completely detached from the
pack. They can still
pivot, but with kicks in with the bomb
so low, does Tesus activate
first? Is this going to be the last
[Music]
round? 28 boys
statues. How does the mental sustain
this? Tess is spotted. Flames he knows.
Apex. Here comes the barrage of util.
Hold your breath. Flames gets one.
That's magical mody. But there's zyu
holding on. 10 seconds. 10 dead. Where's
the bomb? Where is the bomb? Messyy's
got to punch it in. Mezi, what can you
do? He's going to run at him. It comes
down to a 1 v one. Messy versus Mezy.
Orb versus M4. Everything to play for.
Million dollars on the line. Mezi could
just survive the 109. We go again. The
Rod Lab Arena are on their feet and
we're getting a game of Counter Strike
that we
deserve. OT number
[Applause]
three. Oh, he needed that head shot.
No time to rest, no time to bask in the
chance. We're straight back into play.
Vitality had three
opportunities. A clean sweep on their T-
side. The challenge put out to Falcons.
You've got to do what we did. You want
to talk about Counterstrike being a
mental game? Send them this clip. Send
them this.
Watch them win the first round now.
Exactly.
kicks and he could could clear him.
Yeah, he's going to go undetected. Okay,
you'd expect Apex to be in this
position. True. And Zu operating with a
rifle, not an AWP. So leaving that. He's
going to clear outside. Is this poor
information, right? They must have an
idea that it could be
possible. There's always a chance
somebody slips. But what does Kixon do
with that?
Zywood deep in the back lines as Monosy
draws blood 4v4. This could be the
roundwinning
move
away down the womb as he topside defense
with flames. Kixson has gone round the
world now just meets up with his team.
Calls it clear. Apex arriving just in
time. Wait. Oh, an opportunity presents
itself. Kicks and takes the head off of
Apex. And now a race to Flames. Swings
open the door. Doesn't finish it off.
Tessus gets softened
up. Bomb can be planted. Cover provided.
Flame swings that door open. All poison.
Ready to pull the
trigger. Flamesy down. Mezi handed an
impossible round. Oh my goodness. Yeah,
he got close. Kixon's the one to
actually convert that. Save them.
An immediate timeout. You get one every
OT. Extly wants a chat. I can't believe
he's called it now. That's a That's a
very premature time out. Well, you think
about it. We've lost four CT side rounds
in a row right now. Perhaps that's the
uh indicator as to why he's pulled the
trigger so quick. What is What is he
addressing right now? What is the
concern? He's talking to Ross. Does he
know the
answer or is he given them the
opportunity to talk it through?
[Applause]
Started with an opener. Apex got the
freebie. Kixson got the space and Monosy
got the
closes. Not in that high.
[Applause]
Melbourne, are you entertained?
I hope you don't have work tomorrow.
[Applause]
Round 38.
Majest getting a bit frisky. Gets to the
vent. Can he get down? Yes, he can.
Maybe audible. That was loud to send.
Maybe not. Zyw brazingly tries to spam
out behind him. Mag is already down
here. Oh,
[Applause]
ruined by a crispy one tap. Oh, hang on.
He's seeing the rotation. Yeah, that's
two. Go back to go back
to this. selling it as best he can. Dips
back around. He's playing cheeky with
it. Zyu holds, converts, calls it quiet.
Mezi readies himself for battle.
Catches, kicks in with a nade in his
hands. Vitality have the edge, but for
how long? Me is going to get swung on by
Tess. Gets his gun out. Using that smoke
to advance. Mezi. Another solid work
from the anchor. Double kill in defense
of his sight. 2v3. Still up for
debate. Oh, Monosy back turned. Wasn't
ready for Apex.
Gets him from heaven. Dips down.
Crouching down. Tessa slips
away. Cleared out. Head shot found.
Beautiful from Tess. Another one
available. Oh, and he's cooking.
Spectacular
aim. Always been a marvel to behold the
mechanics of Tess, but now he's putting
it on display in a grand final triple
OT. Flames has had some shaky moments
and right now a 1 v one. Tess.
He's had some impact this
one. This one will be
unfounded. 37 kills, 39 points of
health, and what is about to be a great
attempt at a
1v3. Plenty of time to get that bomb
down. Rotation from Flames. He had a
near miss in the last 1 v3.
[Applause]
Smoke for the bomb. It's going to make
this real tough.
elects to go
ramp.
Flames
arrives. Tess thinking this one through.
Not getting the smoke on the bomb. He
will now.
Planted open. Oh, that's scary. Now that
sound queue. Tessus an audible reload.
Flames just trying to fake him out.
Tessus doesn't get panicked. But the
time the time time. Flames has got to
hold it. He just has to spam him. Just
has to get him off the bomb. He can't
find him. He can't find him.
denied. Sensational on the first
two. Tess a couple of near misses in the
clutch. Oh, what? He can't believe
there's a lot of smoke for that
situation. You think you're going to get
a heads up duel in that situation. You
can play from either left or right, but
the smoke's in play. And he hears that
sound que. Oh, this is beautiful, isn't
it? Oh, stunning. Some of the best spray
transfer moments in Counterstrike. And
right there, just putting that aim in
the shop window.
Can you believe that he is the man
leading the scoreboard right now for
Falcons? Earning his stripes.
Finally, a CT round for Vitality. And a
big round attributed to
Flames. No perfect run this
time. Bit of back and forth. Bit of tip
for tap. Blow for blow.
Oh,
and he's pissed.
Apex pinned to the back wall. Moments in
this game need to be studied. We have
had some crazy crazy plays. Wasn't ready
for that angle, was he? Mezi
[Applause]
falls. Monosy extends their advantage.
Yeah, starting to come apart, it seems
for both teams. Everything looking a
little bit
scrappier. Who's got the willpower?
Who's going to stay in
power? Another 5v3 situation. Plenty of
these squandered in tonight's game
across the five map
[Applause]
affair again with the base. Nico so good
at jostling an or out of position.
Flames goes down.
Monosy connecting. Rob's just the one.
He needs a whole lot more where that
came from. And even a team kill can't
stop him.
We're looking for 22.
2121 and we get damn deep in this
thing. Number four
awaits to the T-side for Vitality. Still
no Zyu AWP. Looks like he's off wanting
to wield these rifles instead. So let's
see how he can get done on the AK.
Oh, shot's not far off. Rotation early
down the
vent. See how it's looking different
this time. It's
Kixon. Stays in
main. Creeping through the smoke. Apex.
He's going to catch the timing. He's
going to try. Hoping that that's enough
of a distraction. And it is turned
around.
Flattened. Top sight. Successful for
Vitality to tie us up. Cyber ready for
Tess. Goes down though. Quick reactions.
This round's still on. It certainly
could be. Need something out of Kickson
just like that. Oh no. Nerve-wracking
now. Apex mezy. Apex pulls it away.
Playing the time. Pulls out the molotov
to delay. Ahead of the smoke already.
They're coming for you. Apex tugs
across. Does deliver. That's impact
fragis. And he's done it.
High impact from their captain. Quiet at
times, but that is a loud one to tie us
up 20 each. Okay, touch and go for a
second
[Applause]
there. Just pushed immediately as that
smoke was landing. They took the space.
Kickson didn't waste a second. The
presence of mind league. He CT V. He
immediately realizes that's not the
play. That ends up with his teammate and
secures the round with a couple of tidy
shots. That's a rough moment. Apex
getting caught with a whole lot of
openings going against him.
First death 10
times, but we're 40 rounds deep. So,
what does that even mean at this point?
Apex ahead of the smoke, looking for a
fight. And he's going to get it.
Honestly, so lucky to be alive, but his
round already
ruined. Nico quickly gets the block
smoke out. They won't be able to
accelerate on that. You wouldn't dare
push through, would you? Syu might. Sou
does. So it was coming for you and Nico
holds on just the
one. SS. Oh, get tested. Flames good for
it again with the aggression. Kickson
just throwing caution to the wind. Just
goes charging in.
Vitality on the very edge of being on
series and ESL Grand Slam point once
more. Yeah, going to have to be the safe
again. We've been here once before.
Honestly, down to 250 bucks. We're not
an AWP into the next. So, are you going
to call out the hunt here, Vitality?
This one's come around damn quick,
hasn't it? These last two rounds,
blinking, you miss
it. We really ready for a fourth
overtime.
might be flashing rod into the spawn
here. Alex, they take that
awkward. Apex softened him up for them.
5 HP. Yeah, d on him. You need to stay
alive, Madisk. And you won't. They take
it all.
Denied. How valuable is that AWP? That's
the question right now that Falcons have
to answer. And apparently Kixen needs
it. He has bought it, dropped it across
Demons, taken an MP9. So they have still
facilitated it. But the fact that
they're willing to take that sacrifice,
you've seen Vitality in the last spree
of overtime starting to move away from
the AWP. Z not wielding on the CT side
as much now on the T side. Not running
with it
either. Falcons back against the wall
yet
again. Ross coming in hot. Coming in
frisky. They got nades with his name on
it. Puts him down to
67. Either
Vitality pick up the ESL Grand Slam
right here and now or we go into quad
overtime Melbourne. This is
ridiculous. Are they really going to try
a again? Are they really going to try
and test this again? Looking the wrong
way. Oh, Magic's been caught out. How
often do we send that this game? Not
often at all. Robs demands it. A
commanding opportunity. There's only one
man that can stop them. It's not going
to happen. Surely Monosy cannot come up
1 v4. Bomb down from the hut. Vitality
made to run for
it.
Tenacious, but it is theirs
now. Put through their paces. Made to
work for it.
Vitality will plunder down
[Applause]
under. Make the most of their golden
opportunity. A period of dominance
marked by
